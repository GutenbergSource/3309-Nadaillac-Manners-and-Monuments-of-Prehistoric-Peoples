<p class="first">The present volume has been translated, with the
author&rsquo;s consent, from the French of the Marquis de Nadaillac.
The author and translator have carefully brought down to date the
original edition, embodying the discoveries made during the progress of
the work. The book will be found to be an epitome of all that is known
on the subject of which it treats, and covers ground not at present
occupied by any other work in the English language.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The nineteenth century, now nearing its close, has
made an indelible impression upon the history of the world, and never
were greater things accomplished with more marvellous rapidity. Every
branch of science, without exception, has shared in this progress, and
to it the daily accumulating information respecting different parts of
the globe has greatly contributed. Regions, previously completely
closed, have been, so to speak, simultaneously opened by the energy of
explorers, who, like Livingstone, Stanley, and Nordenski&ouml;ld, have
won immortal renown. In Africa, the Soudan, and the equatorial regions,
where the sources of the Nile lie hidden; in Asia, the interior of
Arabia, and the Hindoo Koosh or Pamir mountains, have been visited and
explored. In America whole districts but yesterday inaccessible are now
intersected by railways, whilst in the other hemisphere Australia and
the islands of Polynesia have been colonized; new <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1345" href="#xd21e1345" name=
"xd21e1345">2</a>]</span>societies have rapidly sprung into being, and
even the unmelting ice of the polar regions no longer checks the
advance of the intrepid explorer. And all this is but a small portion
of the work on which the present generation may justly pride
itself.</p>
<p>Distant wars too have contributed in no small measure to the
progress of science. To the victorious march of the French army we owe
the discovery of new facts relative to the ancient history of Algeria;
it was the advance of the English and Russian forces that revealed the
secret of the mysterious lands in the heart of Asia, whence many
scholars believe the European races to have first issued, and of this
ever open book the French expedition to Tonquin may be considered at
present one of the last pages.</p>
<p>Geographical knowledge does much to promote the progress of the
kindred sciences. The work of Champollion, so brilliantly supplemented
by the Vicomte de Roug&eacute; and Mariette Bey, has led to the
accurate classification of the monuments of Egypt. The deciphering of
the cuneiform inscriptions has given us the dates of the palaces of
Nineveh and Babylon; the interpretation by savants of other
inscriptions has made known to us those Hittites whose formidable power
at one time extended as far as the Mediterranean, but whose name had
until quite recently fallen into complete oblivion. The rock-hewn
temples and the yet more strange dagobas of India now belong to
science. Like the sacred monuments of Burmah and Cambodia they have
been brought down to comparatively recent dates; and though the palaces
of Yucatan and Peru still maintain their reserve, we are able to fix
their dates approximately, and to show that long before <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1351" href="#xd21e1351" name=
"xd21e1351">3</a>]</span>their construction North America was inhabited
by races, one of which, known as the Mound Builders, left behind them
gigantic earthworks of many kinds, whilst another, known as the Cliff
Dwellers, built for themselves houses on the face of all but
inaccessible rocks.</p>
<p>Comparative philology has enabled us to trace back the genealogies
of races, to determine their origin, and to follow their migrations.
Burnouf has brought to light the ancient Zend language, Sir Henry
Rawlinson and Oppert have by their magnificent works opened up new
methods of research, Max M&uuml;ller and Pictet in their turn by
availing themselves of the most diverse materials have done much to
make known to us the Aryan race, the great educator, if I may so speak,
of modern nations.</p>
<p>To one great fact do all the most ancient epochs of history bear
witness: one and all, they prove the existence in a yet more remote
past of an already advanced civilization such as could only have been
gradually attained to after long and arduous groping. Who were the
inaugurators of this civilization? Who ware the earliest inhabitants of
the earth? To what biological conditions were they subject? What were
the physical and climatic conditions of the globe when they lived? By
what flora and fauna were they surrounded? But science pushes her
inquiry yet further. She desires to know the origin of tire human race,
when, how, and why men first appeared upon the earth; for from whatever
point of view he is considered, man must of necessity have had a
beginning.</p>
<p>We are in fact face to face with most formidable problems, involving
alike our past and future; problems <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e1359" href="#xd21e1359" name="xd21e1359">4</a>]</span>it is
hopeless to attempt to solve by human means or by the help of human
intelligence alone, yet with which science can and ought to grapple,
for they elevate the soul and strengthen the reasoning faculties.
Whatever may be their final result, such studies are of enthralling
interest. &ldquo;Man,&rdquo; said a learned member of the French
Institute, &ldquo;will ever be for man the grandest of all mysteries,
the most absorbing of all objects of contemplation.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1361src" href="#xd21e1361" name=
"xd21e1361src">1</a></p>
<p>Let us work our way back through past centuries and study our remote
ancestors on their first arrival upon earth; let us watch their early
struggles for existence! We will deal with facts alone; we will accept
no theories, and we must, alas, often fail to come to any conclusion,
for the present state of prehistoric knowledge rarely admits of
certainty. We must ever be ready to modify theories by the study of
facts, and never forget that, in a science so little advanced, theories
must of necessity be provisional and variable.</p>
<p>Truly strange is the starting-point of prehistoric science. It is
with the aid of a few scarcely even rough-hewn flints, a few bones that
it is difficult to classify, and a few rude stone monuments that we
have to build up, it must be for our readers to say with what success,
a past long prior to any written history, which has left no trace in
the memory of man, and during which our globe would appeal to have been
subject to conditions wholly unlike those of the present day.</p>
<p>The stones which will first claim our attention, some of them very
skilfully cut and carefully polished, have been known for centuries.
According to Suetonius, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1371" href=
"#xd21e1371" name="xd21e1371">5</a>]</span>the Emperor Augustus
possessed in his palace on the Palatine Hill a considerable collection
of hatchets of different kinds of rock, nearly all of them found in the
island of Capri, and which were to their royal owner the weapons of the
heroes of mythology. Pliny tells of a thunder-bolt having fallen into a
lake, in which eighty-nine of these wonderful stones were soon
afterwards found.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1373src" href="#xd21e1373"
name="xd21e1373src">2</a> Prudentius represents ancient German warriors
as wearing gleaming <i>ceraunia</i> on their helmets; in other
countries similar stones ornamented the statues of the gods, and formed
rays about their heads.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1382src" href=
"#xd21e1382" name="xd21e1382src">3</a></p>
<p>A subject so calculated to fire the imagination has of course not
been neglected by the poets. Claudian&rsquo;s verses are well
known:</p>
<div lang="la" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Pyren&aelig;isque sub antris</p>
<p class="line">Ignea flumine&aelig; legere ceraunia nymph&aelig;.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Marbodius, Bishop of Rennes, in the eleventh century,
sang of the thunder-stones in some Latin verses which have come down to
us, and an old poet of the sixteenth century in his turn exclaimed, on
seeing the strange bones around him</p>
<div lang="fr" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Le roc de Tarascon h&eacute;bergea quelquefois</p>
<p class="line">Les g&eacute;ants qui couroyent les montagnes de
Foix,</p>
<p class="line">Dont tant d&rsquo;os successifs rendent le
t&eacute;moignage.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">With these stones, in fact, were found numerous bones
of great size, which had belonged to unknown creatures. Latin authors
speak of similar bones found in Asia Minor, which they took to be those
of giants <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1403" href="#xd21e1403"
name="xd21e1403">6</a>]</span>of an extinct race. This belief was long
maintained; in 1547 and again in 1667 fossil remains were found in the
cave of San Ciro near Palermo; and Italian savants decided that they
had belonged to men eighteen feet high. Guicciadunus speaks of the
bones of huge elephants carefully preserved in the H&ocirc;tel de Ville
at Antwerp as the bones of a giant named Donon, who lived 1300 years
before the Christian era.</p>
<p>In days nearer our own the roost cultivated people accepted the
remains of a gigantic batrachian<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1407src"
href="#xd21e1407" name="xd21e1407src">4</a> as those of a man who had
witnessed the flood, and it was the same with a tortoise found in Italy
scarcely thirty years ago. Dr. Carl, in a work published at
Frankfort<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1416src" href="#xd21e1416" name=
"xd21e1416src">5</a> in 1709, took up another theory, and, such was the
general ignorance at the time, he used long arguments to prove that the
fossil bones were the result neither of a freak of nature, nor of the
action of a plastic force, and it was not until near the end of his
life that the illustrious Camper could bring himself to admit the
extinction of certain species, so totally against Divine revelation did
such a phenomenon appear to him to be.</p>
<p>Prejudices were not, however, always so obstinate. For more than
three centuries stones worked by the hand of man have been preserved in
the Museum of the Vatican, and as long ago as the time of Clement VIII.
his doctor, Mercati, declared these stones to have been the weapons of
antediluvians who had been still ignorant of the use of metals.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1421" href="#xd21e1421" name=
"xd21e1421">7</a>]</span></p>
<p>During the early portion of the eighteenth century a pointed black
flint, evidently the head of a spear, was found in London with the
tooth of an elephant. It was described in the newspapers of the day,
and placed in the British Museum.</p>
<p>In 1723 Antoine de Jussieu said, at a meeting of the <i lang=
"fr">Acad&eacute;mie des Sciences</i>, that these worked stones had
been made where they were found, or brought from distant countries. He
supported his arguments by an excellent example of the way in which
savage races still polish stones, by rubbing them continuously
together.</p>
<p>A few years later the members of the <i lang="fr">Acad&eacute;mie
des Inscriptions</i> in their turn, took up the question, and Mahudel,
one of its members, in presenting several stones, showed that they bad
evidently been cut by the hand of man. &ldquo;An examination of
them,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;affords a proof of the efforts of our
earliest ancestors to provide for their wants, and to obtain the
necessaries of life.&rdquo; He added that after the re-peopling of the
earth after the deluge, men were ignorant of the use of metals.
Mahudel&rsquo;s essay is illustrated by drawings, some of which we
reproduce (<a href="#fig001">Fig. 1</a>), showing wedges, hammers,
hatchets, and flint arrow-beads taken, he tells us, from various
private collections.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1437src" href=
"#xd21e1437" name="xd21e1437src">6</a></p>
<p>Bishop Lyttelton, writing in 1736, speaks of such weapons as having
been made at a remote date by savages ignorant of the use of
metals,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1443src" href="#xd21e1443" name=

<p>A communication made by Fr&egrave;re to the Royal Society of London
deserves mention here with a few supplementary remarks.<a class=

<p>This distinguished man of science found at Hoxne, in Suffolk, about
twelve feet below the surface of the soil, worked flints, which had
evidently been the natural weapons of a people who had no knowledge of
metals. With these flints were found some strange bones with the
gigantic jaw of an animal then unknown. Fr&egrave;re adds that the
number of chips of flint was so great that the workmen, ignorant of
their scientific value, used them in road-making. Every thing pointed
to the conclusion that Hoxne was the place where this primitive people
manufactured the weapons and implements they used, so that as early as
the end of last century a member of the Royal Society formulated the
propositions,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1468src" href="#xd21e1468"
name="xd21e1468src">10</a> now fully accepted, that at a very remote
epoch men used nothing but stone weapons and implements, and that side
by side with these men lived huge animals unknown in historic times.
These facts, strange as they appear to us, attracted no attention at
the time. It would seem that special acumen is needed for every fresh
discovery, and that until the time for that discovery comes, evidence
remains unheeded and science is altogether blind to its
significance.</p>
<p>But to resume our narrative. It is interesting to note the various
phases through which the matter passed before the problem was solved.
In 1819, M. Jouannet announced that he had found stone weapons near
P&eacute;rigord. In 1823, the Rev. Dr. Buckland published the
&ldquo;Reliqui&aelig; Diluvian&aelig;,&rdquo; the value of which,
though it is a work of undoubted merit, was greatly lessened by the
preconceived ideas of its author. A few years later, Tournal announced
his discoveries in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1476" href=
"#xd21e1476" name="xd21e1476">10</a>]</span>the cave of Bize, near
Narbonne, in which, mixed with human bones, he found the remains of
various animals, some extinct, some still native to the district,
together with worked flints and fragments of pottery. After this,
Tournal maintained that man had been the contemporary of the animals
the bones of which were mixed with the products of human
industry.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1478src" href="#xd21e1478" name=
"xd21e1478src">11</a> The results of the celebrated researches of Dr.
Schmerling in the caves near Li&egrave;ge were published in 1833. He
states his conclusions frankly: &ldquo;The shape of the flints,&rdquo;
he says, &ldquo;is so regular, that it is impossible to confound them
with those found in the Chalk or in Tertiary strata. Reflection compels
us to admit that these flints were worked by the hand of man, and that
they may have been used as arrows or as knives.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1486src" href="#xd21e1486" name=
"xd21e1486src">12</a> Schmerling does not refer, though Lyell does, and
that in terms of high admiration, to the courage required for the
arduous work involved in the exploration of the caves referred to, or
to the yet more serious obstacles the professor had to overcome in
publishing conclusions opposed to the official science of the day.</p>
<p>In 1835, M. Joly, by his excavations in the Nabrigas cave,
established the contemporaneity of man with the cave bear, and a little
later M. Pomel announced his belief that plan had witnessed the last
eruptions of the volcanoes of Auvergne.</p>
<p>In spite of these discoveries, and the eager discussions to which
they led, the question of the antiquity of man and of his presence
amongst the great Quaternary <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1493"
href="#xd21e1493" name="xd21e1493">11</a>]</span>animals made but
little progress, and it was reserved to a Frenchman, M. Boucher de
Perthes, to compel the scientific world to accept the truth.</p>
<p>It was in 1826 that Boucher de Perthes first published his opinion;
but it was not until 1816 and 1847 that he announced his discovery at
Menchecourt, near Abbeville, and at Moulin-Quignon and Saint Acheul, in
the alluvial deposits of the Somme, of flints shaped into the form of
hatchets associated with the remains of extinct animals such as the
mammoth, the cave lion, the <i>Rhinoceros incisivus</i>, the
hippopotamus, and other animals whose presence in France is not alluded
to either in history or tradition. The uniformity of shape, the marks
of repeated chipping, and the sharp edges so noticeable in the greater
number of these hatchets, cannot be sufficiently accounted for either
by the action of water, or the rubbing against each other of the
stones, still less ply the mechanical work of glaciers. We must
therefore recognize in them the results of some deliberate action and
of an intelligent will, such as is possessed by man, and by man alone.
Professor Ramsay<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1500src" href="#xd21e1500"
name="xd21e1500src">13</a> tells us that, after twenty years&rsquo;
experience in examining stones in their natural condition and others
fashioned by the hand of man, he has no hesitation in pronouncing the
flints and hatchets of Amiens and Abbeville as decidedly works of art
as the knives of Sheffield. The deposits in which they were found
showed no sins of having been disturbed; so that we may confidently
conclude that the men who worked these flints lived where the banks of
the Somme now are, when these deposits were in course of being laid
down, and that he was the contemporary of the animals <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1505" href="#xd21e1505" name=
"xd21e1505">12</a>]</span>whose bones lay side by side with the
products of his industry.</p>
<p>This conclusion, which now appears so simple, was not accepted
without difficulty. Boucher de Perthes defended his discoveries in
books, in pamphlets, and in letters addressed to learned societies. He
had the courage of his convictions, and the perseverance which insures
success. For twenty years he contended patiently against the
indifference of some, and the contempt of others. Everywhere the proofs
he brought forward were rejected, without his being allowed the honor
of a discussion or even of a hearing. The earliest converts to De
Perthes&rsquo; conclusions met with similar attacks and with similar
indifference. There is nothing to surprise us in this; it is human
nature not to take readily to anything new, or to entertain ideas
opposed to old established traditions. The most distinguished men find
it difficult to break with the prejudices of their education and the
yet more firmly established prejudices of the systems they have
themselves built up. The words of the great French fabulist will never
cease to be true:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Man is ice to truth;</p>
<p class="line">But fire to lies.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">One of the masters of modern science, Cuvier, has
said<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1516src" href="#xd21e1516" name=
"xd21e1516src">14</a>: &ldquo;Everything tends to prove that the human
race did not exist in the countries where the fossil bones were found
at the time of the convulsions which buried those bones; but I will not
therefore conclude that man did not exist at all before that epoch; he
may <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1522" href="#xd21e1522" name=
"xd21e1522">13</a>]</span>have inherited certain districts of small
extent whence he re-peopled the earth after these terrible
events.&rdquo; Cuvier&rsquo;s disciples went beyond the doctrines of
their master. He made certain reservations; they admitted none, and one
of the most illustrious, &Eacute;lie de Beaumont, rejected with scorn
the possibility of the co-existence of man and the mammoth.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1524src" href="#xd21e1524" name=
"xd21e1524src">15</a> Later, retracting an assertion of which perhaps
he himself recognized the exaggeration, he contented himself with
saying that the district where the flints and bones had been collected
belonged to a recent period, and to the shifting deposits of the slopes
contemporary with the peaty alluvium. He added&mdash;scientific
passions are by no means the least intense, or the least deeply
rooted&mdash;that the worked flints may have been of Roman origin, and
that the deposits of Moulin-Quignon may have covered a Roman road! This
might indeed have been the case in the <i>D&eacute;partement du
Nord</i>, where a road laid down by the conquerors of Gaul has
completely disappeared beneath deposits of peat, but it could not be
true at Moulin-Quignon, where gravels form the culminating point of the
ridge. Moreover, the laying down of the most ancient peats of the
French valleys did not begin until the great watercourses had been
replaced by the rivers of the present day; they never contain, relics
of any species but such as are still extant; whereas it was with the
remains of extinct mammals that the flints were found.</p>
<p>It was against powerful adversaries such as this that the modest
savant of Abbeville had to maintain his opinion. &ldquo;No one,&rdquo;
he says, &ldquo;cared to verify the facts of the case, merely giving as
a reason, that these <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1535" href=
"#xd21e1535" name="xd21e1535">14</a>]</span>facts were
impossible.&rdquo; Weight was added to his complaint by the refusal in
England about the same blue to print a communication from the Society
of Natural History of Torquay, which announced the discovery of flints
worked by the hand of man, associated, as were those of the Somme, with
the bones of extinct animals. The fact appeared altogether too
incredible!</p>
<p>But the time when justice would be done was to come at last. Dr.
Falconer visited first Amiens and then Abbeville, to examine the
deposits and the flints and bones found in them. In January, 1859, and
in 1860, other Englishmen of science followed his example; and
excavations were made, under their direction, in the massive strata
which rise, from the chalk forming their base, to a height of 108 feet
above the level of the Somme. Their search was crowned with success,
and they lost no blue in leaking known to the world the results they
had obtained, and the convictions to which these results lead
led.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1539src" href="#xd21e1539" name=
"xd21e1539src">16</a> In 1859 Prestwich announced to the Royal Society
of London that the flints found in the bed of the Somme were
undoubtedly the work of the hand of plan, that they had been found in
strata that lead not been disturbed, and that the men who cut these
flints bad lived at a period prior to the time when our earth assumed
its present configuration. Sir Charles Lyell, in his opening address at
a session of the British Association, did not hesitate to support the
conclusions of Prestwich. It <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1551"
href="#xd21e1551" name="xd21e1551">15</a>]</span>was now the turn of
Frenchmen of science to arrive at Abbeville. MM. Gaudry and Pouchet
themselves extracted hatchets from the Quaternary deposits of the
Somme.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1553src" href="#xd21e1553" name=
"xd21e1553src">17</a> These facts were vouched for by the well-known
authority, M. de Quatrefages, who had already constituted himself their
advocate. All that was now needed was the test of a public discussion,
and the meeting of the Anthropological Society of Paris supplied a
suitable occasion. The question received long and searching scientific
examination. All doubt was removed, and M. Isidore
Geoffroy-Saint-Hilaire was the mouth-piece of an immense majority of
his colleagues, when he declared that the objections to the great
antiquity of the human race had all melted away. The conversion of men
so illustrious was followed of course by that of the general public,
and, more fortunate than many another, Boucher de Perthes bad the
satisfaction before his death of seeing a new branch of knowledge
founded on his discoveries, attain to a just and durable popularity in
the scientific world.</p>
<p>It must not, however, be supposed that popular superstition yielded
at once to the decisions of science, and it is curious to meet with the
same ideas in the most different climates, and in districts widely
separated from each other:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1560src" href=
"#xd21e1560" name="xd21e1560src">18</a> Everywhere worked flints are
attributed to a supernatural origin; everywhere they are looked upon as
amulets with the power of protecting their owner, his house or his
flocks. Russian peasants believe them to be the arrows of thunder, and
fathers transmit them to their children as precious <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1563" href="#xd21e1563" name=
"xd21e1563">16</a>]</span>heirlooms. The same belief is held in France,
Ireland, and Scotland, in Scandinavia, and Hungary, as well as in Asia
Minor, in Japan, China, and Burn lap; in Java, and amongst the people
of the Bahama Islands, as amongst the negroes of the Soudan or those of
the west coast of Africa,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1565src" href=
"#xd21e1565" name="xd21e1565src">19</a> who look upon these stones as
bolts launched from Heaven by Sango, the god of thunder; amongst the
ancient inhabitants of Nicaragua as well as the Malays, who, however,
still make similar implements.</p>
<p>The name given to these flints recalls the origin attributed to
them. The Romans call them <i>ceraunia</i> from <span class="trans"

celts, adzes, and gouges or knives, are known as thunder stones. A
Chinese emperor, who lived in the eighth century of our era, received
from a Buddhist priest some valuable presents which the donors said had
been sent by the Lord of Heaven, amongst which were two flint hatchets
called <i>loui-kong</i>, or stones of the god of thunder. In Brazil we
meet with the same idea in the name of <i>corsico</i>, or lightnings,
given to worked flints; whilst in Italy, by all exception almost
unique, they are called <i lang="it">lingue san Paolo</i>.</p>
<p>May we not also attribute to the worship of stones some of the
religious and funeral rites of antiquity? According to Porphyry,
Pythagoras, on his arrival on the island of Crete, was purified with
thunder-stones by the dactyl priests of Mount Ida. The Etruscans wore
flint arrow-heads on their collars. They were sought after by the Magi,
and the Indians gave them an honored place in their temples. According
to Herodotus, the Arabs sealed their engagements by making an incision
in their hands with a sharp stone; in Egypt the body of a corpse before
being embalmed was opened with a flint knife; a similar implement was
used by the Hebrews for the rite of circumcision; and it was also with
cut stones that the priests of Cybele inflicted self-mutilation in
memory of that of Atys. At Rome the stone hatchet was dedicated to
Jupiter Latialis, and solemn treaties were ratified by the sacrifice of
a pig, the throat of which was cut with a sharp flint. According to
Virgil, this custom was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1651" href=
"#xd21e1651" name="xd21e1651">18</a>]</span>handed down to the ancient
Romans by the uncouth nation of the Equicoles. At the beginning of the
Christian era., the heroes commemorated by Ossian still had in the
centre of their shields a polished stone consecrated by the Druids, and
a saga maintains that the <i>ceraunia</i> assured certain victory to
their owners. On the other side of the Atlantic, the Aztecs used
obsidian blades for the sacrifices, in which hundreds of human victims
perished miserably; and similar blades are used by the Guanches of
Teneriffe to open the bodies of their chiefs after death. At the
present day, the Albanian Palikares use pointed flints to cut the flesh
off the shoulder-blade of a sheep with a view to seeking in its fibres
the secrets of the future, and when the god Gimawong visits his temple
of Labode, on the western coast of Africa, his worshippers offer him a
bull slain with a stone knife. Lumholtz,<a class="noteref" id=

second of his recent explorations in Queensland, tells us that the
natives still use stone weapons, varying in form and in the handles
used, and that the weapons of the Australians living near Darling
River, as well as those of the Tasmanians, are without handles.</p>
<p>During the first centuries of the Christian era, strange rites were
still performed in honor of dolmens and menhirs. The councils of the
Church condemned them, and the emperors and kings supported by their
authority the decrees of the ecclesiastics.<a class="noteref" id=

this direction, and one generation transmits its traditions and
superstitions to another. In the seventeenth century a Protestant
missionary called in the aid of the secular arm to destroy a
superstition deeply rooted in the minds of his people; in England,
sorcerers were proceeded against for having used flint arrow-heads in
their pretended witchcraft; in Sweden, a polished hatchet yeas placed
in the bed of women in the pangs of labor; in Burmah, thunder-stones
reduced to powder were looked upon as an infallible cure for
ophthalmia; and the Canaches have a collection of stones with a special
superstition connected with each. But why seek examples so far away and
in a past so remote? In our own day anti in our own land we find men
who think themselves invulnerable and their cattle safe if they are
fortunate enough to possess a polished flint.</p>
<p>Prehistoric times are generally divided into three epochs&mdash;the
<i>Stone Age</i>, the <i>Bronze Age</i>, and the <i>Iron Age</i>. We
owe this classification to the arch&aelig;ologists of Northern
Europe.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1680src" href="#xd21e1680" name=

maintained that iron was the first metal used, founding his contention
on the scarcity of tin, the difficulty of obtaining alloys, and on the
sixty-one iron foundries of Switzerland which may date from prehistoric
times. The rarity of the discovery of iron objects, he urged, is
accounted for by the ease with which such objects are destroyed by
rust. There has never been a Bronze or an Iron age in America, so
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1690" href="#xd21e1690" name=
"xd21e1690">20</a>]</span>that it would seem very doubtful whether all
races went through the same cycles of development. I myself prefer the
division into the <i>Pal&aelig;olithic</i> period, when men only used
roughly chipped stones, and the <i>Neolithic</i> period, when they
carefully polished their stone weapons. &ldquo;There may,&rdquo; says
Alexander Bertrand,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1698src" href=
"#xd21e1698" name="xd21e1698src">28</a> &ldquo;be one immutable law for
the succession of strata throughout the entire crust of the earth, but
there is no corresponding law applicable to human agglomerations or to
the succession of the strata of civilization. It would be a very grave
error to adopt the theory according to which all human races have
passed through the same phases of development and have gone through the
same complete series of social conditions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It may perhaps be convenient to introduce a fourth period when
copper alone was used and our ancestors were still ignorant of the
alloys necessary for the production <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

Hesiod speaks of a third generation of men as possessing copper only,
and although it does not do to attach undue importance to isolated
facts, recent discoveries in the Cevennes, in Spain, in Hungary, and
elsewhere, appear to confirm the existence of an age of copper
(<a href="#fig002">Fig. 2</a>). We may add that the mounds of North
America contain none but copper implements and ornaments, witnesses of
a time when that metal alone was known either on the shores of the
Atlantic or of the Pacific<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1713src" href=

<p>It is impossible to fix the duration of the Stone age. It began with
man, it lasted for countless centuries, and we find it still prevailing
amongst certain races who set their faces against all progress. The
scenes sculptured upon Egyptian monuments dating from the ancient
Empire represent the employment of stone weapons, and their use was
continued throughout the time of the Lagid&aelig; and even into that of
the Roman domination. A few years ago, on the shores of the Nile, I saw
some of the common people shave <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e1742" href="#xd21e1742" name="xd21e1742">22</a>]</span>their
heads with stone razors, and the Bedouins of Gournah using spears
headed with pointed flints. The Ethiopians in the suite of Xerxes had
none but stone weapons, and yet their civilization was several
centuries older than that of the Persians. The excavations on the site
of Alesia yielded many stone weapons, the glorious relics of the
soldiers of Vercingetorix. At Mount Beuvray, on the site of Bibracte,
flint hatchets and weapons have been discovered associated with Gallic
coins. At Rome, M. de Rossi collected similar objects mixed with the
<i>&AElig;s rude</i>. Flint hatchets are mentioned in the life of St.
&Eacute;loy, written by St. Owen, and the Merovingian tombs have
yielded hundreds of small cut flints, the last offerings to the dead.
William of Poitiers tells us that the English used stone weapons at the
battle of Hastings in 1066, and the Scots led by Wallace did the same
as late as 1288. Not until many centuries after the beginning of the
Christian era did the Sarmatians know the use of metals; and in the
fourteenth century we find a race, probably of African origin, making
their hatchets, knives, and arrows of stone, and tipping their javelins
with horn. The Japanese, moreover, used stone weapons and implements
until the ninth and even the tenth century A.D.</p>
<p>But there is no need to go back to the past for examples. The
Mexicans of the present day use obsidian hatchets, as their fathers did
before them; the Esquimaux use nephritis and jade weapons with
Remington rifles. Nordenski&ouml;ld tells us that the Tchoutchis know
of no weapons but those made of stone; that they show their artistic
feeling in engravings on bone, very similar to those found in the caves
of the south of France. In 1854, the Mqhavi, an Indian <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1749" href="#xd21e1749" name=
"xd21e1749">23</a>]</span>tribe of the Rio Colorado (California),
possessed no metal objects; and it is the same with the dwellers on the
banks of the Shingle River (Brazil), the Oyacoulets of French Guiana,
and many other wandering and savage races. P&egrave;re Pelitot tells us
that the natives living on the banks of the Mackenzie River are still
in the stone age; and Schumacker has given an interesting example of
the manufacture of stone weapons by the Klamath Indians dwelling on the
shores of the Pacific. It has been justly said: &ldquo;The Stone age is
not a fixed period in time, but one phase of the development of the
human race, the duration of which varies according to the environment
and the race.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1751src" href=
"#xd21e1751" name="xd21e1751src">30</a></p>
<p>In thus limiting our idea of the stone age, we may conclude that
alike in Europe and in America,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1756src"
href="#xd21e1756" name="xd21e1756src">31</a> there has been a period
when metal was entirely unknown, when stones were the sole weapons, the
sole tools of man, when the cave, for which he had to dispute
possession with bears and other beasts of prey, was his sole and
precarious refuge, and when clumsy heaps of stones served alike as
temples for the worship of his gods and sepulchral monuments in honor
of his chiefs.</p>
<p>Excavations in every department of France have yielded thousands of
worked flints, and there are few more interesting studies than an
examination of the mural map in the Saint Germain Museum on which are
marked with scrupulous exactitude the dwelling-places of our most
remote ancestors, and the megalithic monuments which are the
indestructible memorials of our forefathers. <span class=

<p>In the Crimea were picked up a number of small flints cut into the
shape of a crescent exactly like those found in the Indies and in
Tunis, and the Anthropological Society of Moscow has introduced us to a
Stone age the memory of which is preserved in the tumuli of Russia. On
the shores of Lake Lagoda have been found some implements of
argillaceous schist, in Carelia and in Finland tools made of slate and
schist, often adorned with clumsy figures of men or of animals. The
rigor of the climate did not check the development of the human race;
in the most remote times Lapland, Nordland, the most northerly
districts of Scandinavia, and even the bitterly cold Iceland, were
peopled. The Exhibition of Paris, 1878, contained some stone weapons
found on the shores of the White Sea.</p>
<p>On several parts of the coast of Denmark we meet with mounds of an
elliptical shape and about nine feet high, with a hollow in the centre,
marking the site of a prehistoric dwelling. It was not until about 1850
that the true nature of these mounds was determined. Excavations in
them have brought to light knives, hatchets, all manner of stone, horn,
and bone implements, fragments of pottery, charred wood, with the bones
of mammals and birds, the skeletons of fishes, the shells of oysters
and cockles buried beneath the ashes of ancient hearths. To these
accumulations the characteristic name of <i>Kitchenmiddings</i>, or
kitchen refuse, has been given.</p>
<p>Several caves have recently been examined in Poland, one of which,
situated near Cracow, appears to belong to Pal&aelig;olithic times.
Count Zawiska has already given an account of his interesting
discoveries to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1771" href=
"#xd21e1771" name="xd21e1771">25</a>]</span>Prehistoric Congress at
Stockholm. In the Wirzchow cave he identified seven different hearths,
and took out of the accumulations of cinders various amulets, clumsy
representations of fish cut in ivory, split bones, bears&rsquo;,
wolves&rsquo;, and elks&rsquo; teeth pierced with a hole for threading,
and more than four thousand stone objects of a similar type to those
found in Russia, Scandinavia, and Germany. We meet with similar traces
of successive habitation in a cave near Ojcow; the valuable contents of
which included some beautiful flint tools, some awls, bone
spatul&aelig;, and some gold ornaments, mixed, in the lower of the
hearths, with the bones of extinct animals, and in the upper, with
those of species still living.</p>
<p>The discoveries made in the Atter See and in the Salzburg lakes with
those in the Moravian caves prove what had previously been very stoutly
denied, the existence in those districts of ancient races at a very
remote date.</p>
<p>The most ancient inhabitants of Hungary, however, cannot be traced
further back than to Neolithic times. In that country have been found,
with polished stone implements, thousands of objects made of stag-horn,
or bone, almost all without exception finely finished off. The
discovery of copper tools and ornaments of a peculiar form in the
Danubian provinces, bears witness to a distinct civilization in those
districts, and confirms what we have just said about a Copper age.</p>
<p>From the Lake Stations of Austria and Hungary, we pass naturally to
those of Switzerland. We shall have to introduce to our readers whole
villages built in the midst of the waters, and a people long completely
forgotten. In many of these stations, none but stone implements have
been found, and on the half-burnt <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e1779" href="#xd21e1779" name="xd21e1779">26</a>]</span>piles on
which the huts had been set up, it is still easy to make out the
notches cut with flint hatchets.</p>
<p>We meet with similar pile dwellings, as these structures are called,
in France, Italy, Germany, Ireland, and England, for from the earliest
times man was constantly engaged in sanguinary contests with his
fellowmen, and sought in the midst of the waters a refuge from the ever
present dangers surrounding him.</p>
<p>The discoveries made in Belgium must be ranked amongst the most
important in Europe, and we shall often have occasion to refer to them.
Holland, on the other hand, having much of it been under the sea for so
long, yields nothing to our researches but a few arrow-heads, hatchets,
and knives made of quartz or diorite, and all of them of the coarsest
workmanship.</p>
<p>No less fruitful in results to prehistoric science are the
researches made in the south of Europe. The congress that met at
Bologna, in 1871, showed us that in the Transalpine provinces man was
witness of those physical phenomena which gave to Italy its present
configuration; and the exhibition in connection with the congress
enabled us to get a good idea of the primitive industry which has left
relics behind it in every district of the peninsula.</p>
<p>Some hatchets of a similar type to the most ancient found in France
were dug out of a gravel pit at San Isidro on the borders of the
Man&ccedil;anar&egrave;s, associated with the bones of a huge elephant
that has long been extinct; and a cave has recently been discovered
near Madrid from which were dug out nearly five hundred skeletons, the
greater number thickly coated with stalagmite. Near the bodies lay
several flint weapons, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1790" href=
"#xd21e1790" name="xd21e1790">27</a>]</span>and some fragments of
pottery.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1792src" href="#xd21e1792" name=
"xd21e1792src">32</a> Cartailhac tells us of similar discoveries in
various parts of Portugal.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1797src" href=
"#xd21e1797" name="xd21e1797src">33</a> The caves of Santander have
yielded worked bones and barbed harpoons; and those of Castile, various
objects resembling those of the Reindeer period of France. It is,
however, an interesting and important fact that the reindeer never
crossed the Pyrenees. Although so far excavations have been anything
but complete, we are already able to assert that during
Pal&aelig;olithic times the ancient Iberia was occupied by races whose
industrial development was similar to that of modern Europe.</p>
<p>It will be well to mention also the excavations made on the slopes
of Mount Hymettus, and in the ever-famous plains of Marathon. Finlay
has brought together in Greece a very interesting collection of stone
weapons and implements which he picked up in great numbers at the base
of the Acropolis of Athens. All these discoveries prove the existence
of man at a time about which but yesterday nothing was known, and to
which it is difficult as yet to give a name, this existence being
proved by the most irrefragable of evidence, the work of his own
hands.</p>
<p>Although the proofs of there having been a Stone age in Western
Europe are absolutely convincing, it is difficult to feel equally sure
with regard to the portions of the globe where so many districts are
closed to the explorer. Everywhere, however, where excavations have
been made, they have yielded the most remarkable results. M. de Ujfalvy
has brought diorite and serpentine hatchets and wedges from the south
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1804" href="#xd21e1804" name=
"xd21e1804">28</a>]</span>Siberia, and Count Ouvaroff tells us of a
Quaternary deposit, the only one known at present at Irkutsk, in
Eastern Siberia, containing cut flints. Near Tobolsk, Poliaskoff found
some beautifully worked stones. Other arch&aelig;ologists tell us of
having found, in the east of the Ural Mountains and on the shores of
the Joswa, hammers, hatchets, pestles, nuclei the shape of polygonal
prisms, and round or long pieces of flint, all pierced with a central
hole, which are supposed to have been spindle whorls. Lastly, Klementz
tells us that the lofty valleys of the Yenesei and its tributaries were
inhabited in the most remote times by races who developed a special
civilization.</p>
<p>At the other extremity of the great Asiatic continent, a deposit of
cinders found at the entrance of a cave near the Nahr el Kelb yielded
some flint knives or scrapers, and more recently a prehistoric station
has been made out at Hanoweh, a little village of Lebanon, east of
Tyre. The flints are of primitive shapes, not unlike the most ancient
forms found in France. They were discovered in a mass of
<i>d&eacute;bris</i> of all kinds, forming a very hard conglomerate.
Some teeth, which had belonged to animals of the bovid&aelig;,
cervid&aelig;, and equid&aelig; groups, were got out with considerable
difficulty, but the bones in the conglomerate were too touch broken up
to be identified. Worked flints and arrow- or spear-heads were also
found in considerable quantities in various parts of the table-land of
Sinai, and at the openings of the caves in which the ancient
inhabitants took refuge. It was with stone tools that these people
worked the mines riddling the sides of the mountains, and it is still
easy to make out traces of their operations. <span class=

<p>We have already alluded to Japan; for a long time the barbarian
A&iuml;nos, the earliest inhabitants of the country, were acquainted
with nothing but stone. Flint arrows were presented to the Emperor
Wu-Wang eleven hundred years before our era; the annals of one of the
ancient dynasties speak of flint weapons, and an encyclop&aelig;dia
published in the reign of the Emperor Kang-Hi speaks of rock hatchets,
some black and some green, and all alike dating from the most remote
antiquity.</p>
<p>Agates worked by the hand of man are found in great quantities in
the bone beds of the Godavery. Some javelin heads in sandstone, basalt,
and quartz, with scrapers and knives, most of them flat on one side and
rounded on the other, appear to be even more ancient than the agate
implements. Some of the celts resemble those of European type, others
the flint weapons found in Egypt, and the clumsiest forms may be
compared to those still in use amongst the natives of Australia. We may
also mention a somewhat rare type lately discovered in the island of
Melas, which have been characterized as saw-bladed knives. A letter
from Rivett-Carnac announces the discovery of weapons and stone
implements in Banda, a wild mountain district on the northwest of
India. The scrapers, he says, strangely resemble those of the
Esquimaux, and the arrow-heads those of the most ancient inhabitants of
America.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1816src" href="#xd21e1816" name=

<p>Many megalithic monuments are met with in places widely removed from
each other in the vast Indian Empire. Captain Congreve, after
describing the cairns <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1824" href=
"#xd21e1824" name="xd21e1824">30</a>]</span>with their rows of stones
ranged in circles, the kistvaens or dolmens, the huge rocks placed
erect as at Stonehenge, the barrows hollowed out of the cliffs,
declares with undisguised astonishment that there is not a Druidical
monument of which he had not seen the counterpart in the Neilgherry
Mountains.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1826src" href="#xd21e1826" name=

<p>General Faidherbe divides Africa into two distinct regions&mdash;one
north of the Great Desert, where the inhabitants and the fauna and
flora have all alike certain characteristics in common with those of
Europe; and the other south of the Sahara, which was at one time
separated from that in the north by a vast inland sea. In this southern
region we are in Nigritia, or the Africa of the negroes, where the
inhabitants in their physical characteristics and in their language,
the mammals, and the plants, differ altogether from those of the north.
In one point, however, these two regions resemble each other: in both
we recognize a Stone age, which existed in Algeria and in Egypt, as
well as on the banks of the Senegal and at the Cape of Good Hope. The
valley of the Nile from Cairo to Assouan has yielded a series of
objects in flint, porphyry, and hornblendic rock, retaining traces of
human workmanship, and reminding us of similar implements of European
type. These objects,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1833src" href=
"#xd21e1833" name="xd21e1833src">36</a> says M. Arcelin, are always
found either beneath modern deposits or at the surface of the upper
plateaux at the highest point to which the river rises; nothing has,
however, been found in the alluvial deposits of the Nile, in spite of
the most persevering search. At the Prehistoric Congress held
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1836" href="#xd21e1836" name=
"xd21e1836">31</a>]</span>at Stockholm, some worked flints were
produced that had been found in the Libyan Desert. This once inhabited
district, now without water or vegetation, can only be reached at the
present day with the greatest difficulty. Is not this yet another proof
of the great changes which have taken place since the advent of man?
Lastly, the Boulak Museum contains a whole series of stone weapons and
implements, showing in their workmanship a progressive development
similar to that we find in Europe. Many arch&aelig;ologists are of
opinion that the worked flints found in the plains of Lower Egypt date
from Neolithic times. Those alone are Paleolithic which have been found
in a deposit hard enough for the hollowing out of tombs, which are
certainly earlier than the eighteenth dynasty. We must add, however,
that neither with the Pal&aelig;olithic nor with the Neolithic relics
have been found any bones of extinct animals. Some savants go yet
further: they think that these worked stones are but chips split off by
the heat of the sun.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1838src" href=
"#xd21e1838" name="xd21e1838src">37</a> A phenomenon of this kind is
mentioned by Desor and Escher de la Linth in the Sahara Desert; Fraas
quotes a similar observation made by Livingstone in the heart of
Africa, and one by Wetzstein, who, not far from Damascus; saw hard
basalt rocks split under the influence of the early morning freshness.
I have myself noticed similar phenomena in the Nile valley, but it must
be added that the fragments of rock broken off by the combined
influence of heat and humidity present very notable differences to
those worked by the hand of man, and cannot really be mistaken for
them. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1841" href="#xd21e1841" name=

<p>In Algeria have been preserved some most interesting relics of
prehistoric times. If I am not mistaken, Worsaae was the first to note
the worked stones in the French possessions in Africa. They have been
picked up in great numbers, especially near the watercourses at which
the ancient inhabitants of the country slaked their thirst, as do their
descendants at the present day. The exploration of the Sahara daily
yields unexpected discoveries; and already fifteen different stations
formerly inhabited by man have been made out. In those remote days a
large river flowed near Wargla, which was then an important centre, and
a number of tools picked up bear witness to the former presence of an
active and industrious population. At one place the flint implements,
arrow-heads, knives, and scrapers are all of a very primitive type, and
were found sorted into piles. This was evidently a
<i>d&eacute;p&ocirc;t</i>, probably forming the reserve stock of the
tribe. Wargla or perhaps Golea at one time appears to have been the
extreme limit of the Stone age in Algeria, but quite recently traces of
primitive man have been discovered amongst the Tuaregs. These relics
are hatchets made of black rock, and arrow-heads not unlike those which
the Arabs attribute to the Djinn; but as we approach the south we find
the flints picked up more clumsily and unskilfully cut&mdash;a proof
that they were the work of a more barbarous people with less practical
skill. It is the megalithic monuments of Algeria, of which we shall
speak more in detail presently, that are the most worthy of attention.
As in India, we meet with them in thousands, and in certain parts of
the continent they extend for considerable distances. They consist of
long, square, circular, or oval enclosures&mdash;<span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1848" href="#xd21e1848" name=
"xd21e1848">33</a>]</span>dolmens similar to those of Western
Europe,&mdash;and almost always surrounded by circles of upright
stones. The silence of historians respecting them need not make us
doubt their extreme antiquity, for did it not take a very long time to
induce the scientific men of our day to turn their attention to Algeria
at all?</p>
<p>The exploration of Tunisia has enabled us to study the Stone age in
that district, and a few years ago it was announced that nearly three
thousand objects of different types had been found in thirteen
different localities.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1852src" href=
"#xd21e1852" name="xd21e1852src">38</a> My son found near Gabes an
immense number of small worked flints not unlike a human nail, the
origin and use of which no one has been able to determine. The
association of weapons and implements roughly finished off, with chips
and stones still in the natural state, bears witness to the existence
at one time of workshops of some importance. The recent discoveries of
Collignon correspond with those in Algeria, and complete our knowledge
of the basin of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>In the Cave of Hercules, in Morocco, which Pomponius Mela spoke of
as of great antiquity in his day, have been found a great many worked
flints, such as knives and arrow-heads. We shall refer later to the
important monument of Mzora and the menhirs surrounding it, the
builders of which certainly belonged to a race that lived much nearer
our own day than did the inhabitants of the Cave of Hercules.</p>
<p>The south of Africa is not so well known as the north, and the
difficulty of making explorations is a great obstacle to progress. For
some centuries, however, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1862" href=
"#xd21e1862" name="xd21e1862">34</a>]</span>polished stone hatchets
from the extreme south of the continent have been preserved in the
museums of Leyden and Copenhagen, under the name of
<i>thunderstones</i>, or <i>stones of God</i>. A great many are found
in British South Africa, especially at Graham&rsquo;s Town and Table
Bay.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1870src" href="#xd21e1870" name=
"xd21e1870src">39</a> Gooch, after describing the physical
configuration of the Cape, says that stone implements are found in all
the terraces at whatever level of the Quaternary deposits. With these
stone objects were found a good many fragments of coarse hand-made
pottery, that had been merely baked in the sun, and was strengthened
with good-sized pieces of quartz. Similar peculiarities are noticed in
ancient European pottery. We shall have to refer again to these
singular analogies, one of the chief aims of this book being to bring
them into notice.</p>
<p>In the torrid regions between the Vaal and the Zambezi rivers, we
find traces of a race of a civilization different from that of the
savages conquered by the English. At Natal the gradual progress of
these unknown people can be traced step by step. To the earliest period
of all belong nothing but roughly hewn flints, and no traces of pottery
have been found; then follow flint arrow-heads of more distinct form,
and here and there fragments of sun-dried pottery. Of more recent date
still are polished stone weapons and more finely moulded pottery;
whilst to the latest date of all belong weapons of considerable variety
of form, better adapted to the needs of man, and with these weapons
were found huge stone mortars which had been used for crushing grain,
and bear witness to the use of vegetable diet. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1878" href="#xd21e1878" name=
"xd21e1878">35</a>]</span></p>
<p>We also meet with important ruins in the Transvaal. Some walls are
still standing which are thirty feet high and ten thick, forming
imperishable memorials of the past. They are built of huge blocks of
granite piled up without cement. We know nothing of those who erected
them; their name and history are alike effaced from the memory of man,
and we know nothing either of their ancestors or of their
descendants.</p>
<p>In the Antipodes certain curious discoveries point to the existence
of man in those remote and mysterious times, to which, for want of a
better, we give in Europe the name of the Age of the Mammoth and the
Reindeer; and everything points to the conclusion that man appeared in
the different divisions of the earth about the same time. Probably the
first appearance of our race in Australia was prior to the last
convulsions of nature which gave to that continent its present
configuration. &ldquo;Scientific studies,&rdquo; says M.
Blanchard,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1883src" href="#xd21e1883" name=
"xd21e1883src">40</a> &ldquo;lead us to believe that at one period a
vast continent rose from the Pacific Ocean, which continent was broken
up, and to a great extent submerged, in convulsions of nature. New
Zealand and the neighboring islands are relics of this great
land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Corrio Mountains in New Zealand, at a height of nearly 4,921
feet above the sea-level, have been found flints shaped by the hand of
man, associated with a number of bones of the Dinornis, the largest
known bird. Other facts bear witness to an extinct civilization, which
we believe to have been extremely ancient, but to which, in the present
state of our knowledge, it is impossible to assign a date. In the
island of Tonga-Taboo, one of the Friendly group, is a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1890" href="#xd21e1890" name=
"xd21e1890">36</a>]</span>remarkable megalith, the base of which rests
on uprights thirty feet high, and supports a colossal stone bowl which
is no less than thirteen feet in diameter by one in height. In the same
island is a trilithon consisting of a transverse bar resting on two
pillars provided with mortises for its reception. The pillars weigh
sixty-five tons, and a local tradition affirms that the coralline
conglomerate out of which they were hewn was brought from Wallis
Island, more than a thousand miles off. It is difficult to
explain<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1892src" href="#xd21e1892" name=
"xd21e1892src">41</a> how the makers of this trilithon managed to
transport, to work, and to place such masses in position. In a
neighboring island a circle of uplifted stones, covering an area of
several hundred yards, reminds us of the cromlechs of Brittany. The
so-called Burial-Mound of Oberea at Otaheite, if it really was
constructed with stone tools, is yet more curious. Imagine a pyramid of
which the base is a long square, two hundred and sixty feet long by
eighty-seven wide. It is forty-three feet high. The top is reached by a
flight of steps cut in the coralline rock, all these steps being of the
same size and perfectly squared and polished.<a class="noteref" id=

<p class="first">Stone statues on Easter Island.</p>
</div>
<p>On a rock at the entrance to the port of Sydney a kangaroo is
sculptured. In Easter Island (Rapa-Nui) La P&eacute;rouse discovered a
number of coarsely executed bust statues (<a href="#fig004">Fig.
4</a>). There are altogether some four hundred of them, forming groups
in different parts of the island. The excavations conducted by Pinart
in 1887 have proved these figures to be sepulchral monuments. He
managed to make a considerable collection of crania and human bones.
Round about the crater <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1911" href=
"#xd21e1911" name="xd21e1911">38</a>]</span>of the Rana-Raraku volcano,
forty of these figures have been counted, all of a similar type, all
cut in one piece of solid trachyte rock. In another place are eighty
busts with longer noses and thicker lips, forming a group by
themselves. The largest of them is some thirty-nine feet high. On the
sides of the volcano, scattered about amongst the statues, have been
picked up a considerable number of knives, scrapers, and pointed pieces
of obsidian, which were probably tools thrown away by the sculptors of
the figures.</p>
<p>These monuments and sculptures are certainly the work of a race very
different from the present natives, who are altogether incapable of
producing anything of the kind, and who retain absolutely no traditions
respecting their predecessors. This complete oblivion, which may appear
rather strange, is by no means rare amongst savage races, and Sir John
Lubbock cites a great many very curious examples. &ldquo;Oral
traditions,&rdquo; says Broca, &ldquo;are changed and distorted by each
succeeding generation; and are at last effaced to give place to others
as transitory, and thus the most important events are, sooner or later,
relegated to oblivion.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1915src" href=

<p>We have dwelt at considerable length in another volume<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1926src" href="#xd21e1926" name=
"xd21e1926src">44</a> on the earliest inhabitants of America. Much
still remains unknown in spite of the considerable and important work
done of late years. The very name of the New World seems to be
altogether out of place, America being as old, if not older, than any
continent of the Eastern Hemisphere. Lund has brought forward weighty
reasons for his theory that the central plateau of Brazil was already a
country when the rest <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1929" href=
"#xd21e1929" name="xd21e1929">39</a>]</span>of the continent was still
submerged or at least represented merely by a few small islets. This
theory, however, even if it could be absolutely proved, would not help
us to fix the date of the earliest presence of man in America, still
less to say by what route he arrived there.</p>

<p>Certain facts, amongst which I would, in the first place, quote the
discoveries of Dr. Abbott in the alluvial deposits of the Delaware and
those recently announced in Nevada,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1938src"
href="#xd21e1938" name="xd21e1938src">45</a> prove the contemporaneity
of men like ourselves with the great edentate and pachydermatous
mammals, which were the most characteristic creatures of the American
fauna. The prehistoric inhabitants of North America were familiar with
the mastodon, those of South America with the glyptodon, the shell of
which on occasion served as a roof to the dwelling of primeval reran,
which dwelling was often but a den <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e1941" href="#xd21e1941" name="xd21e1941">40</a>]</span>hollowed
out of the ground. As in Europe, the early inhabitants of America had
to contend with powerful mammals and fierce carnivora; and in the West
as in the East man made up in intelligence for his lack of brute force,
and however formidable an animal might be, it was condemned to submit
to, or disappear before, its master. In course of time Sedentary
replaced Nomad races; shell heaps, some of marine, some of riverine and
lacustrine species, but all alike mixed with a great variety of
rubbish, were gradually piled up extending for many miles and covering
many acres of ground, bearing witness to the existence of a population
already considerable.</p>

(<a href="#fig006">Fig. 6</a>). These earthworks extend throughout

<p>At a period probably nearer our own, Arizona and New Mexico were
occupied by other maces, who built the so-called <i>pueblos</i>, which
were regular phalansteries, or communal dwellings, each member of the
tribe having to be content with one wretched little cell (<a href=
"#fig007">Fig. 7</a>). At some distance from the men of the
<i>pueblos</i> lived the Cliff Dwellers, about whom we know next to
nothing; a few stone weapons and countless fragments of pottery being
all they have left behind them. These men established themselves in
situations which are now inaccessible, hewing out a dwelling in

a wealth, alas, which also enervated the vital forces, so that the
Spanish and Portuguese met with but little serious resistance in their
rapid conquests.</p>

<p>Such are the facts with which we have to deal. In <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1998" href="#xd21e1998" name=
"xd21e1998">43</a>]</span>the following chapters we shall consider more
at length the problems they present, but already we are led to one
important conclusion: in every part of the globe, in every latitude, in
every climate, worked flints, whether but roughly chipped or
elaborately polished, present analogies which must strike the most
superficial observer. &ldquo;We find them,&rdquo; remarks an American
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2000" href="#xd21e2000" name=
"xd21e2000">44</a>]</span>author, &ldquo;in the tumuli of Siberia, in
the tombs of Egypt, in the soil of Greece, beneath the rude monuments
of Scandinavia; but whether they come front Europe or Asia, from Africa
or America, they are so much alike in form, in material, and in
workmanship, that they might easily be taken for the work of the same
men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of
Science in 1871, Sir John Lubbock showed worked flints from Chili and
New Zealand with others found in England, Germany, Spain, Australia,
the Guianas, and on the banks of the Amazon; which one and all belonged
to the same type. More recently the Anthropological Society of Vienna
compared the stone hatchets found near the Canadian lakes and in the
deserts of Uruguay, with others from Catania in Italy, Angerm&uuml;nde
in Brandenburg, and a tomb in Scandinavia, deciding that they were all
exactly alike. Lastly, those who studied at the French Exhibition of
1878 the hatchets, hammers, and scrapers, the bone implements, pottery,
and weapons brought from different places, the inhabitants of which had
no communication with each other, could not fail to notice in their
turn how impossible it was to distinguish between them. &ldquo;So
evident is this resemblance,&rdquo; says Vogt,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2004src" href="#xd21e2004" name="xd21e2004src">47</a> &ldquo;that
we may easily confound together implements brought from such very
different sources.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The same observation applies to megalithic monuments. Everywhere we
find these primitive structures assuming similar forms. It is difficult
enough to believe that the wants of man alone, such as the craving for
food, the need of clothing, and the necessity of defending himself,
have led in every case to the same ideas and the same amount of
progress. Even if this be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2012"
href="#xd21e2012" name="xd21e2012">45</a>]</span>proved by the worked
flints, we cannot accept a similar conclusion with regard to the
megalithic monuments, which imply reflection and a thought of the
future far beyond the material needs of daily life. Is it not more
reasonable to regard a similitude so striking as a proof of the unity
of our race?</p>
<p>The human bones discovered are yet more convincing testimony.
Excavations have yielded some which may date from the very earliest
period of the existence of man upon the earth. They have been found in
caves and in the river drift, beneath the mounds of America and the
megalithic monuments of Europe, in the ice-clad districts of
Scandinavia and of Iceland, and in the burning deserts of Africa, but
not one of them owes its existence to men of a type different from
those of historic times or of our own day.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2016src" href="#xd21e2016" name="xd21e2016src">48</a> MM.
Quatrefages and Hamy in their magnificent work &ldquo;Crania
Ethnica,&rdquo; have been able to distinguish prehistoric races and
indicate the area they occupied. These races are still represented, and
their descendants of to-day retain the characteristics of their
ancestors.</p>
<p>One final conclusion is no less interesting. These absolutely
countless flints, these monuments of imposing size, these stones of
immense weight often brought from afar, these marvellous mounds and
tumuli, bear witness to the presence of a population which was already
considerable at the time of which <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e2024" href="#xd21e2024" name="xd21e2024">46</a>]</span>we are
endeavoring to make out the traces. A long series of centuries must
have been needed for a people to increase to such an extent as to have
spread over entire continents. And time was not wanting. Whatever
antiquity may be attributed to the human race, whatever the initial
date to which its first appearance may be relegated, this antiquity is
but slight, this date is but modern, if we compare it with the truly
incalculable ages of which geology reveals the existence. At every turn
we are arrested by the immensity of time, the immensity of space, and
yet our knowledge is still confined to the mere outer rind of the
earth, and science cannot as yet even guess at the secrets hidden
beneath that rind.</p>
<p>In concluding these introductory remarks, we must add that very
great difficulties await those who devote themselves to prehistoric
studies&mdash;difficulties such as noise but those who have attempted
to conquer them can realize. The rare traces of prehistoric man must be
sought amongst the effects of the cataclysms that have devastated the
earth, and the ruins piled up in the course of ages. We must show mall
wrestling with the ever-recurrent difficulties of his hard life, and
gradually developing in accordance with a law which appears to be
immutable. Such is the aim of this work, and it is with gratitude that
we assert at the beginning that the <i>pianta uomo</i>, the human
plant, as Alfieri calls our race, was endowed by the Creator from the
first with a very vigorous vitality, to enable it to contend with the
dangers besetting its steps in the early days of its existence, and
with a truly marvellous spirit, to be able to make so humble a
beginning the starting-point for a destiny so glorious. <span class=

&ldquo;Quaternary man is always man in every acceptation of the word.
In every case in which the bones collected have enabled us to judge, he
has ever been found to have the hand and foot proper to our species,
and that double curvature of the spinal column has been made out, so
characteristic that Serres made it the distinctive attribute of his
human kingdom. In every case with him, as with us, the skull is more
fully developed than the face. In the Neanderthal skull so often quoted
as bestial, the cranial capacity is more than double that ever found in
the largest gorilla.&rdquo; De Quatrefages: &ldquo;<span lang=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The first care of man on his arrival upon the earth
was necessarily to make sure of food. Wild berries, acorns, and
ephemeral grasses only last for a time, whilst land mollusca and
insects, forming but a miserable diet at the best, disappear during the
winter. Meat must certainly have been the chief food of prehistoric
man; the accumulations of bones of all sorts in the caves and other
places inhabited by him leave no doubt on that point. The horse, which
in Europe was hunted, killed, and eaten for many centuries before it
was domesticated, was an important article of diet, and was
supplemented by the aurochs, the stag, the chamois, the wild goat, the
boar, the bare, and failing them, the wolf, the fox, and above all the
reindeer, which multiplied rapidly in districts suitable to it. The
elephant bones picked up on Mount Dol and elsewhere are nearly all
those of young animals; and it is probable that they had been killed
for food by man. In the Sureau Cave in Belgium,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2040src" href="#xd21e2040" name="xd21e2040src">1</a> in that of
Aurignac in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2043" href="#xd21e2043"
name="xd21e2043">48</a>]</span>France, and Brixham in England, have
been found complete skeletons of the <i>Ursus spel&aelig;us</i>, which
bad evidently been dragged in with the flesh still on them, for all the
bones are in their natural position. In other caves, the thorax and the
vertebr&aelig; of the skeletons were missing; the cave-man, having
despatched his victim, bad evidently taken only the more succulent
parts into his retreat. Beasts of prey merely gnaw the comparatively
tender and spongy tops of the bones, leaving the hard, compact parts
untouched. In the caves that were inhabited by man, however, we find
the apophyses neglected, whilst the diaphyses are split open. We
cannot, therefore, make any mistake on this point, or attribute to the
beast of prey what is certainly the work of man.</p>
<p>Whilst he evidently preferred to hunt and eat the larger mammals,
man when pressed by hunger did not despise the small rodents, which
were, of course, more easily captured. Amongst piles of the bones of
horses and stags have been found the remains of martens, hedgehogs, and
mice; and from the Thayngen Cave have been taken the bones of more than
five hundred bares. In Belgium the water-rat seems to have been
considered a dainty, and in the Chaleux Cave alone were found more than
twenty pounds&rsquo; weight of the bones of this creature, nearly all
bearing traces of having been subjected to the action of fire.</p>
<p>The remains of birds are rarer, and Broca has remarked that the most
ancient hunting implements which have come down to us; those from the
Moustier Cave, for instance, were adapted rather to attack animals that
would show fight than those that would simply fly or run away. The
Gourdan Cave, however, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2052" href=
"#xd21e2052" name="xd21e2052">49</a>]</span>has yielded the bones of
the moor-fowl, the partridge, the wild duck, and even the domesticated
cock And hen; the Frontal Cave, the thrush, the duck, the partridge,
and the pigeon; and in other caves were found the bones of the goose,
the swan, and the grouse. Milne-Edwards enumerates fifty-one species
belonging to different orders found in the caves of France, and M.
Rivi&egrave;re picked up the remains of thousands of birds in those of
Baouss&eacute;-Rouss&eacute; on the frontier of Italy.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2054src" href="#xd21e2054" name=
"xd21e2054src">2</a></p>
<p>The skulls of the mammals bad been opened, and the bones split.
Brains and marrow probably figured at feasts as the greatest
delicacies. Travellers, whose tales are a help to us in building up a
picture of the remote past of our race, relate that the Laplanders, as
soon as an animal is killed, break open its skull and devour the brain
whilst it is still warm and bleeding. This was probably also the custom
amongst prehistoric cave-men.</p>
<p>The flesh of animals was not, alas, the only meat eaten, and
excavations in different parts of the globe have led to the discovery
of traces of the practice of cannibalism which it is difficult not to
accept.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2061src" href="#xd21e2061" name=
"xd21e2061src">3</a></p>
<p>Dr. Spring noticed at Chauvaux a great many bones which were nearly
all those of women and children, side by side with which lay others of
ruminants belonging to species still extant. All these bones bad alike
been subjected to great heat, and none but those which bad contained no
marrow were left unbroken. This appears an incontrovertible proof of
cannibalism, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2069" href=
"#xd21e2069" name="xd21e2069">50</a>]</span>Dr. Spring concludes that
it was certainly practised by the earliest inhabitants of Belgium. We
must add, however, that other excavations in the same cave at Chauvaux
prove that it was used as a burial-place, some skeletons being ranged
in regular order with weapons and stone implements placed beside
them.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2071src" href="#xd21e2071" name=
"xd21e2071src">4</a> M. Dupont mentions having found in the caves of
the Lesse, which date from the Reindeer period, human bones mixed with
other remains of a meal. He notes a similar fact in another cave that
he considers belongs to Neolithic times. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he adds,
&ldquo;none of these bones bear any trace of having been struck with a
flint or other tool with a view to their fracture. If any of them are
broken it is transversely, and the cause of the fracture has been
merely the weight of the earth above them; moreover, they show no trace
of the action of fire.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2083src" href=
"#xd21e2083" name="xd21e2083src">5</a> M. Dupont, therefore, still
retains some doubt of the cannibalism of the cave-men of the valley of
the Lesse, and attributes the presence of the bones of the dead amongst
the rubbish of all kinds accumulated by the living, to their idleness
and indifference. One example at the present day tends to confirm this
opinion, for travellers tell us of the same revolting carelessness
amongst the Esquimaux, who cannot certainly be classed amongst
cannibals.</p>
<p>The Abb&eacute; Chierici, speaking at the Brussels Congress<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2088src" href="#xd21e2088" name="xd21e2088src">6</a>
of the excavations in one of the Reggio caves, remarked that human
bones were mixed with those of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2091"
href="#xd21e2091" name="xd21e2091">51</a>]</span>animals, and that both
showed traces of having been burnt. These bones date from the Neolithic
period, and with them were picked up various objects of remarkable
workmanship, including fragments of pottery, half a grindstone for
crushing grain, and some admirably polished serpentine hatchets.</p>
<p>Other facts leave no doubt of the cannibalism of the earliest
inhabitants of Italy. Moreover, hesitation on this point is impossible
for other reasons, as Roman historians allude to the practice.
Pliny,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2095src" href="#xd21e2095" name=
"xd21e2095src">7</a> in saying how little removed was a human sacrifice
from a meal, adds, that it ought not to surprise us to meet with this
monstrous custom amongst barbarian races, as it prevailed in ancient
times in Italy and Sicily.</p>
<p>It is generally admitted that we can tell whether the fracture of
long bones was intentional by the way in which they were broken. This
fact, which is true alike with the bones of men and of animals, is the
most important proof we have of the cannibalism of the men of the Stone
age. To the examples already given, we can easily add others culled
from France. In the Pyrenees and in the caves of Lourdes and Gourdan,
for instance, human bones have been found mixed with the cinders and
ashes of the hearth, and still bearing the marks of the implements with
which they were broken.</p>
<p>At Bruniquel a human skull was found which had been opened in the
same way as the heads of ruminants amongst which it was picked up, and
on its external surface were deep notches, which appear to have been
made with a flint hatchet. Similar traces of revolting feasts on human
flesh are not at all rare; near Paris, at Villeneuve-Saint-Georges, and
at Varenne-Saint-Maur, for instance.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2103src" href="#xd21e2103" name="xd21e2103src">8</a></p>
<p>The excavations in the Montesquieu-Avant&egrave;s Cave, about six
miles from Saint-Girons, have brought to light a hearth covered over
with a layer of stalagmite; numerous fragments of human bones, crania,
femora, tibi&aelig;, humeri, and radii were found in this layer, and in
that of the subjacent clay. In many cases the medullary orifice had
been enlarged to make it easier to get out the marrow. It is impossible
to attribute this to a rodent, for the bones gnawed by animals of that
kind present a regular series of marks. The conclusion is inevitable:
these bones, alike of men and of animals, were the remains of a
meal.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2108src" href="#xd21e2108" name=
"xd21e2108src">9</a></p>
<p>In Kent&rsquo;s Hole, the celebrated cave in Devonshire, amongst
many objects dating from the Stone age, were found some human bones
bearing traces of having been gnawed by man. The eminent
anthropologist, Owen, came to a similar conclusion&mdash;that
cannibalism had been practised&mdash;after examining the jaw-bone of a
child found in Scotland; and so did the Rev. F. Porter, after the
excavations near Scarborough, where several skeletons were found under
a tumulus, which had apparently been thrown where they were discovered
by accident.</p>
<p>The Cesareda caves in Portugal have yielded some bones split
lengthwise; and beneath the dolmen near the village of Hammer, in
Denmark, human bones and those of stags have been found half gnawed,
and showing only too clearly the origin of the marks upon them. Worsaae
quotes similar facts at Borreby, Chantres refers to the same thing in
the caves of the Caucasus, Captain Burton at Beitsahur, near Jerusalem,
Wiener in the <i>sambaquis</i> of Brazil, even in deposits which he
considers of recent origin.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2123src" href=
"#xd21e2123" name="xd21e2123src">10</a></p>
<p>Brazil is not the only part of the American continent in which we
find traces of the use of this revolting food. In the kitchen-middings
of Florida Wyman found human bones, which had been intentionally
broken, mixed with those of deer and beavers. The marrow had been taken
from all of them and eaten by man. Yet more recent discoveries of a
similar kind have been made in New England.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2130src" href="#xd21e2130" name="xd21e2130src">11</a></p>
<p>We must, however, add that many of these facts are contested. Every
people considers it a point of honor to repudiate the idea that its
ancestors fed on human flesh, and yet everywhere history tells us of
the practice of cannibalism. Herodotus speaks of it amongst the
Androphag&aelig; and the Issedones, people of Scythian origin;
Aristotle amongst the races living on the borders of the Pontus
Euxinus; Diodorus Siculus amongst the Galatians; and Strabo, in his
turn, says: &ldquo;The Irish, more savage than the Bretons, are
cannibals and polyphagous; they consider it an honor to eat their
parents soon after life is extinct.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2137src" href="#xd21e2137" name="xd21e2137src">12</a></p>
<p>From the ancient tombs of Georgia have been taken human bones that
have been boiled or charred, which were doubtless those of the victims
eaten by the assistants in the <i>f&ecirc;tes</i> which have ever
accompanied funeral rites.</p>
<p>In the fourth century of our era Jerome speaks of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2147" href="#xd21e2147" name=
"xd21e2147">54</a>]</span>having met in Gaul with the Attacotes,
descended from a savage Scotch tribe, who fed on human flesh, and that
though they possessed great herds of cattle and flocks of sheep, with
numbers of pigs, for whom their vast forests afforded excellent grazing
grounds<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2149src" href="#xd21e2149" name=
"xd21e2149src">13</a>; and though the Scandinavian kitchen-middings
have not so far yielded any traces of the practice of cannibalism, Adam
of Bremen, who preached Christianity at the court of King Sweyn Ulfson,
represents the Danes of his day as barbarians clad in the skins of
beasts, chasing the aurochs and the eland, unable to do more than
imitate the cries of animals and devouring the flesh of their
fellow-men.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2152src" href="#xd21e2152" name=
"xd21e2152src">14</a></p>
<p>Nothing could exceed the barbarity of the Mexican sacrifices, the
numbers of the victims, and the refinements of torture to which they
were subjected. Prisoners, who had often been fattened for months
previously, perished by thousands on the altars. The palpitating flesh
was distributed amongst the assistants, and a horrible custom compelled
the priests to clothe themselves in the still bleeding skins of the
unfortunate wretches, and to wear them until they rotted to pieces.</p>
<p>Without going back to an antiquity so remote, in how many different
regions of Africa and America, and in how many islands of Polynesia
have not our sailors and missionaries reported the practice of
cannibalism in our own day? It is difficult, therefore, not to believe,
although the fact cannot perhaps be very distinctly proved, that the
first inhabitants of Europe <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2162"
href="#xd21e2162" name="xd21e2162">55</a>]</span>degraded as were the
conditions of their existence, did eat human flesh and acquire a
depraved taste for it; impelled thereto not only by the pangs of
hunger, but also by a revolting superstition.</p>
<p>Animals, however, were very plentiful all around. Stags, elks,
aurochs, horses, and the large pachyderms multiplied very rapidly in
the wide solitudes, the pasture lands of which afforded them a
constantly renewed supply of food, and the beasts of prey in their turn
found an easy prey in the ruminants.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2166src" href="#xd21e2166" name="xd21e2166src">15</a> The ways of
animals do not change, and the travellers who are exploring the
interior of Africa tell us that now, as in the day we are trying to
recall, hundreds of elephants and rhinoceroses congregate in a limited
area, whilst innumerable herds of giraffes, zebras, and gazelles graze
peacefully in the presence of man, whose destructive powers they have
not yet learnt to dread.</p>
<p>Delegorgue speaks of one lake peopled by more than one hundred
hippopotami, and of a region less than three miles in diameter
containing six hundred elephants. Livingstone tells us that he saw
troops of more than four thousand antelopes pass at a time, and that
these animals showed absolutely no fear. We may give a yet more curious
instance. Captain Gordon <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2194" href=
"#xd21e2194" name="xd21e2194">56</a>]</span>Cumming, crossing the
plains stretching away on the north of the Cape, saw troops of gazelles
and antelopes, compelled by a long drought to migrate in search of the
water indispensable to them, and be describes with enthusiasm one of
these migrations, telling us that the plain was literally covered with
animals, the hurrying herds defiling before him in an endless stream.
On the evening of the same day, a yet more numerous herd passed by in
the same direction, the numbers of which were absolutely incalculable,
but which, according to Cumming, must have exceeded several hundred
thousand.</p>
<p>Such must have been animal life in Europe in Quaternary times.
&ldquo;Grand indeed,&rdquo; cries Hugh Miller, &ldquo;was the fauna of
the British Isles in those days. Tigers, as large again as the biggest
Asiatic species, lurked in the ancient thickets; elephants, of nearly
twice the bulk of the largest individuals that now exist in Africa or
Ceylon, roamed in herds; at least two species of rhinoceros forced
their way through the primeval forest, and the lakes and rivers were
tenanted by hippopotami as bulky and with as great tusks as those of
Africa.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2198src" href="#xd21e2198"
name="xd21e2198src">16</a></p>
<p>Material proofs of the presence of animals are not wanting. The
accumulation of coprolites in the cave of Sentenheim (Alsace) bears
witness to the number of bears which once haunted it. Nordmann took
from a cave near Odessa 4,500 bones of ursid&aelig;, associated with no
less numerous relics of the large cave-lion and cave-hyena.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2203src" href="#xd21e2203" name=
"xd21e2203src">17</a> The K&uuml;lock Cave, now some six hundred
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2208" href="#xd21e2208" name=
"xd21e2208">57</a>]</span>and fifty feet above the river, contained the
remains of no less than 2,500 bears, and similar relics occur by
thousands in the osseous breccia of Santenay and in the cave of Lherm,
where they form a regular ossuary. It would be easy to quote similar
facts from Belgian, German, and Hungarian caves. In almost every case
the position of the skeletons seems to show that the bears sought a
last refuge in the caves, and that death had surprised them during
their winter sleep. Pachyderms were no less numerous than bears. The
remains of mammoths are found from the north of Europe to Greece and
Spain, and we meet with them in Algeria, in Asia from the Altai
Mountains to the Arctic Ocean, and in America in Mexico and Kentucky.
They seem to have entrenched themselves especially in Siberia, whence
tusks are still exported as an article of commerce. In the extreme
North, those parts of Wrangel&rsquo;s Land which have been explored are
strewn with the bones of mastodons, and in some parts of Sonora and
Columbia these remains form almost inexhaustible deposits.</p>
<p>Animals of the cervine and equine groups were, if possible, yet more
numerous. M. Piette estimates the number of reindeer whose bones he has
picked up in the Gourdan Cave as over. 3,000, and the number of
cervid&aelig; found at Hohlefels is positively incalculable.</p>
<p>In 1826, Marcel de Serres called attention to the great number of
the bones of animals of the equine family found in the neighborhood of
Lunel-Viel; at Solutr&eacute;, the remains of horses cover a great
portion of the slope which stretches from the eastern side of the
mountain to the bottom of the valley. Here are found those vast
accumulations to which the inhabitants of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2214" href="#xd21e2214" name=
"xd21e2214">58</a>]</span>valley give the characteristic name of
<i>horse-walls</i>. The number of horses, the bones of which have gone
to form these walls, may be estimated without exaggeration at 40,000.
The bones are mixed together in the greatest confusion, many of them
show traces of having been burnt, and the flesh of the horse was
evidently the favorite diet of the people of Solutr&eacute;.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2219src" href="#xd21e2219" name=
"xd21e2219src">18</a></p>
<p>At first man obtained by force, often aided by strategy, the animals
he coveted. He bad not yet learnt to tame them and reduce them to
servitude. Neither the reindeer nor the horse was as yet domesticated,
and neither in the caves nor in the various deposits elsewhere has a
complete skeleton been found, but only&mdash;a very significant
fact&mdash;the bones on which had been the greater amount of flesh. The
absence of any remains of the dog, so indispensable an animal in the
keeping of flocks, is yet another proof that domestication was still
unpractised.</p>
<p>It was with most miserable weapons, such as a few stones, scarcely
even rough-hewn, and a few flint arrows, that the cave-man did not
hesitate to attack the most formidable animals, and with such
apparently inadequate means he succeeded in wounding and even killing
them. The French Museum possesses mammoth and rhinoceros bones bearing
fine scratches produced by the weapons which had been used to despatch
the animals. The metacarpus of a large beast of prey, found at
Eyzi&egrave;s, retains marks no less clear, and the skull of a bear
front Nabrigas has in it a large wound which must have been made by a
missile of some kind.</p>
<p>In Ireland a stone hammer was found wedged into <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2236" href="#xd21e2236" name=
"xd21e2236">59</a>]</span>the head of a <i>Cervus megaceros</i>; in
Cambridgeshire, the skull of an <i>Ursus spel&aelig;us</i> still
containing the fragment of a celt which had given the animal his
deathblow; at Richmond (Yorkshire) the bones of a large deer which had
been sawn with a flint implement. The fine collection in the University
of Lund, contains a vertebra of a urns pierced by an arrow, and the
Copenhagen Museum, the jaw of a stag pierced by a fragment of flint.
Steenstrup mentions two bones of a large stag into which stone chips
had penetrated deeply, and in which the fracture had been gradually
covered over by the bony tissue. A bone of some bovine animal with an
arrow deeply imbedded in it has been taken from a bed of peat in the
island of Mo&euml;n, celebrated for its tumuli and the number of
objects found in them. At Eyzi&egrave;s, a flint flake has been found
firmly fixed in one of the lumbar vertebrae of a young reindeer, and M.
de Baye mentions an arrow with a tranverse edge stuck in the bone of a
badger.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2244src" href="#xd21e2244" name=
"xd21e2244src">19</a> The Abb&eacute; Ducrost found a flint arrow-head
sticking in a vertebra of a horse.</p>
<p>Nor were those already mentioned the only animals on which man made
war. We shall speak presently of the contests with each other, which
began amongst men in the very earliest days of humanity. Human bones,
perforated by arrows and broken by stone hatchets, bear ineffaceable
traces to this day of homicidal struggles.</p>
<p>In many places fresh-water and marine fish were utilized as food by
man. In the numerous caves of the Vez&egrave;re, in those of Madeleine,
Eyzi&egrave;s, and Bruniquel, excavations have brought to light the
vertebr&aelig; and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2251" href=
"#xd21e2251" name="xd21e2251">60</a>]</span>other bones of fishes,
amongst which predominate chiefly those of the jack, the carp, the
bream, the drub, the trout, and the tench&mdash;in a word, all the fish
which still people our rivers and lakes. In the Lake Stations of
Switzerland, fish of all kinds are no less abundant. At Gardeole,
amongst the bones of mammals have been found the shells of mollusca,
and remains of the turtle and of goldfish. Fish was not, however,
caught by all these primitive people, not even by all those who lived
by the sea. In researches carefully carried on for years in the
Maritime-Alps, M. Rivi&egrave;re found neither fishing-tackle nor
fish-lines.</p>
<p>Whilst the cave-men of the south of France seem not to have utilized
any but fresh-water fish, the Scandinavians, at a date probably less
remote however, did not hesitate to brave the ocean. The
kitchen-middings contain numerous remains of fish, amongst which those
of the mackerel, the dab, and the herring are the most numerous. There,
too, we meet with relics of the cod, which never approaches the coast,
and must always be sought by the fisherman in the open sea.</p>
<p>Although we are in a position to assert that men were able to catch
fish during every prehistoric period, if not in every locality, we can
speak less positively of their mode of doing so. The earliest
fishing-tackle was doubtless of the most primitive description: the
bone of some animal, a fragment of hard wood, or even a fish-bone
pointed at each end and pierced with a hole, served their purpose
(<a href="#fig010">Fig. 10</a>). The Exhibition of Fishing-Tackle held
at Berlin in 1880 contained several such implements, some of wood,
others of bone. Others have also been found in the Madeleine Cave, and
in different stations of the ancient inhabitants of Switzerland.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2261" href="#xd21e2261" name=

to those still in use amongst the Esquimaux.</p>

<p>Prehistoric mail also turned to account the teeth of animals. We may
quote in this connection the molars <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e2270" href="#xd21e2270" name="xd21e2270">62</a>]</span>of a bear
from which the enamel and the crown have been removed, and the
thickness of which has been lessened by rubbing (<a href="#fig011">Fig.
11</a>). The small flints picked up in great numbers in the department
of the Gironde also date from a remote antiquity; they are sixteen
millimetres long by four wide, and though we cannot assert it as a
fact, they are supposed to have been used for catching fish.</p>

<p>The Museum of Lund possesses two flint fish-books of a curved shape,
one of them, which is four centimetres long by nearly three wide, was
found by the seashore; the other and smaller one came front the shores
of Lake Kranke.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2287src" href="#xd21e2287"
name="xd21e2287src">20</a> Fish-hooks made of bone, which is more
easily worked than flint, very soon replaced those in that material.
They are numerous in the Lake Stations of Wangen, Mooseedorf, and St.
Aubin. Some are cut out of the horns of oxen, others of stags&rsquo;
antlers; while others again are made of boars&rsquo; tusks (Fig. 12),
but all alike greatly resemble modern forms. The peat-bogs of Scania
have yielded a bone fish-hook seven centimetres long, which is
considered very ancient, and the Museum of Stettin possesses one, also
very old, found in a gnarly deposit of Pomerania. We must not forget to
mention, although it probably <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2290"
href="#xd21e2290" name="xd21e2290">63</a>]</span>belongs to a much more
recent period, a fish-hook in reindeer horn, now in the Christiania
Museum. It was found in a tomb in the island of Kjelno&euml;, not far
from the Russian frontier. Numerous skeletons, wrapped up in swathings
of birch-bark, repose in this tomb. All around lay fragments of
pottery, lance- and arrow-heads,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2292src"
href="#xd21e2292" name="xd21e2292src">21</a> and combs of reindeer
horn, the date of which it is impossible to fix exactly.</p>
<p>In America, stone fish-hooks are rare. The most ancient are of bone,
and resemble those now in use. They have been picked up in Dakota, and
in the cinderheaps of Madisonville (Ohio), in Indiana, in Arkansas, on
the shores of Lake Erie, and in a kitchen-midding of Long Island. The
greater number of them are polished, and some of them have near the top
a hole by which they could be fastened to a line or cord. The
fish-hooks of California are remarkable for their rounded forms and
sharply curved points; the top was covered with a thick layer of
asphalt to which the line was probably fastened. They are numerous in
all the islands of the Pacific coast. In that of Santa Cruz Schumacker
excavated a tomb which must have been that of a fish-hook manufacturer,
for care had been taken to place near the deceased, not only the
implements of his craft, but also a number of fish-hooks in various
stages of advancement. The Californians used the shells of the <i lang=
"la">Mytilus Californicus</i> and <i lang="la">Haliotis</i> to make
fish-hooks, and these were even more curved than those made of bone.
The shape seems but little suited <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e2303" href="#xd21e2303" name="xd21e2303">64</a>]</span>for
fishing, but even in our own day the natives of the Samoa Islands use
similar tackle with great success. The Indians of the northwest coast
make fish-hooks of epicea wood, and those of Arizona utilize for the
same purpose the long spikes of the cactus. It is very probable that
European as well as American races knew how to use wood in the same
manner. During the lapse of centuries, however, these fragile objects
have been reduced to dust, and we are unable to make any further
conjectures on the subject.</p>
<p>The use of bronze, the first metal to be generally employed, does
not seem to have introduced any great modifications in fishing-tackle.
Bronze fish-hooks are, however, thinner and lighter than those in other
materials, and resemble those in use amongst fishermen at the present
day. A certain number have been found in the Lake Stations of
Switzerland, in lakes Peschiera and Bourget, as well as in Scotland,
Ireland, and the island of F&uuml;nen off the coast of Denmark. We must
not omit to mention the important foundry of Larnaud, or the
<i>cache</i> of Saint-Pierre-en-Chatre, both so rich in bronze objects.
In America, where the copper mines of Lake Superior were worked at a
remote antiquity, a few rare copper fish-hooks have been found, the
greater number in the Ancon necropolis.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2310src" href="#xd21e2310" name="xd21e2310src">22</a> Gold
fish-hooks are comparatively more numerous, and have been discovered in
New Granada and the Cauca State.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2313src"
href="#xd21e2313" name="xd21e2313src">23</a> One of these was found
some forty-nine feet below the surface of the ground, and as there is

look like big pins with the lower end bent back upon the upper.</p>
<p>Other fishing implements were also used by our prehistoric
ancestors. At Laugerie-Basse a rough drawing shows us a man striking
with a harpoon a fish that is trying to escape. These harpoons were
generally made of reindeer horn (Figs. <a href="#fig010">10</a> and
<a href="#fig013">13</a>). Some had but one barb, others several. One
of the largest was found in the Madeleine Cave; it is eight inches
long, and has three barbs on one side and five on the other. Most of
these weapons have a notch in the handle, with the help of which they
could be firmly fastened to a spear or lance. Different fashions
prevailed in different localities, and sinews, leather thongs, roughly
plaited cords, creepers, and resinous substances were often pressed
into the service.</p>

Concise in Switzerland. Excavations in Victoria Cave, near Settle
(Yorkshire), yielded amongst other interesting objects a bone harpoon
cut to a point and with two barbs on either side. On the banks of the
Uswiata, a little Polish river flowing into the Dnieper, two harpoons
made out of the horns of some bovine animal were found, both in perfect
preservation, and with several barbs.<a class="noteref" id=

Ouvaroff, in an excellent work published a little before his death,
mentions a bone spear from the shores of the Oka, and Madsen and
Montelius speak of Scandinavian harpoons. These weapons must have been
especially useful in the North during the severe frosts of winter. The
fisherman made a hole in the ice and struck the fish with his harpoon
when the poor creatures came up to the surface to breathe.</p>
<p>From the most remote times the Americans knew how to make and use
harpoons. As many as twenty-eight different kinds are known.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2345src" href="#xd21e2345" name=
"xd21e2345src">25</a> In some the barbs are bilateral, but most of them
have them on one side only. Some, however, are made of stag or elk
horn, and one harpoon from Maine is made of whalebone. A harpoon-point
found near Detroit (Michigan) is nearly a foot long by one inch thick.
Excavations in a rock shelter in Alaska yielded a harpoon which lay
side by side with some of the most ancient Quaternary mammals of
America. A good many copper harpoon-heads are also mentioned; one of
the largest from Wisconsin is ten inches long. Others have been found
in the island of Santa Barbara (California) <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2348" href="#xd21e2348" name=
"xd21e2348">67</a>]</span>and in Tierra del Fuego, where the natives of
the present day still use similar ones. These harpoons with barbs are
by no means simple weapons, the idea of which would naturally occur to
the human mind, so that it is really extremely strange to find weapons
so entirely similar in regions so different and so widely separated
from one another. This constant similitude in the working of the genius
of man is, as We shall never tire of repeating, one of the most
striking facts revealed by prehistoric researches.</p>
<p>Herodotus tells that the P&oelig;ni (Carthaginians) plunged baskets
into the water and drew them up full of fish. It is probable that the
Lake Dwellers of Helvetia employed a similar process, but these ancient
Swiss were already more advanced than that. They knew how to cultivate
hemp, to spin it, and to make nets of it; the remains of some of these
nets have often of late years been taken from the beds of the
lakes.</p>
<p>It is almost impossible to class with any certainty the numerous
Lake Stations of Switzerland. Some few certainly date from the Stone
age, others from the transition period, between it and that of the
early use of metals, or even from the Bronze age. As therefore they
have been occupied at different times by different people, some of them
having even been still in use in the time of the Romans, it is most
difficult to fix with any precision the date to which belong the
various objects mixed together beneath the deep waters of the lakes. We
can only say that the nets differ very much in the size of the meshes,
and the thickness of the rope used. Those found at Robenhausen are very
like those in use in France at the present day. There has, in fact,
been no advance in the art of making <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e2354" href="#xd21e2354" name=
"xd21e2354">68</a>]</span>fishing-tackle since the remote days of the
Lake Dwellers.</p>
<p>We are ignorant of the mode of manufacture of prehistoric nets. Did
the Lake Dwellers, as some arch&aelig;ologists are disposed to think,
use a loom? Did they use shuttles and rollers such as are employed by
the Esquimaux and Californians of the present day? It is impossible to
say, but it is supposed that the bears&rsquo; teeth sharpened to a
point, found in some stations, were used to tighten the meshes. These
meshes were generally square, and each one was finished of with a knot
of the same size at each intersection.</p>
<p>The lead weights so indispensable to fishermen of the present day
for sinking the nets, were represented in prehistoric times by stones.
These stones, which are drilled or notched, are found in all the Lake
Stations. The fragments of pottery pierced with a hole found at
Schussenried, a Lake Station of the Stone age on the Feder-See
(Wurtemburg), were probably used for the same purpose. In some of the
Swiss Lake Stations have also been found pieces of wood and cork,
pierced with one or more holes, which had certainly served as
floats.</p>
<p>Numerous stone implements of the most primitive forms, often of rock
not native to the country, have been found in some of the islands of
Greece, as well as in Corsica, Sardinia, Elba, and Sicily. These
discoveries bear witness to the presence of man in these islands at a
very remote antiquity, though no other traces of the existence of
prehistoric human beings have as yet been found there. These men can
only have reached the islands by way of the sea. Boats were the only
means of communication between the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e2362" href="#xd21e2362" name="xd21e2362">69</a>]</span>Lake
Dwellers of Switzerland and the mainland, and, as we have seen, the
ancient Scandinavians hunted fish on the deep ocean. We must therefore
admit that attempts at navigation were made in the very earliest days
of humanity. Alan, impelled by necessity, or perhaps only by curiosity,
was not afraid to launch his bark, first upon the rivers, and later
upon the more formidable waves of the sea</p>

<p class="first">The Latin poet is right, and we cannot but admire
those who were the first to brave the terrors of the deep and the
horrors of the tempest; for they were gifted alike with the
intelligence which conceives, the courage that dares, and the strength
that achieves.</p>
<p>Trees torn up by the roots by the force of the waters, and floating
on the surface of those waters, naturally attracted the attention of
primeval man, and the first boats were doubtless the trunks of such
trees roughly squared and then hollowed out with the help of fire.
Later experience led to the addition of a prow which would more easily
cleave the water, and a stern which would serve as a pivot. These
canoes, if such a name may be already given to them, were at first
guided by branches stripped of their leaves, or with long poles. Then
oars or paddles were introduced, which are better for beating the
water, and in later barks traces have been made out of what is supposed
to have been a mast, indicating the use of a sail. The art of
navigation may now be said to have been <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e2380" href="#xd21e2380" name=
"xd21e2380">70</a>]</span>inaugurated. In different parts of Europe
have been found boats which certainly belong to very remote times,
though their exact date cannot be fixed. Their construction greatly
resembles that of the pirogues of the Polynesians, or the kayaks of the
Greenlanders. One of the most ancient, now in the Berlin Provincial
Museum, was taken from a peat-bog of Brandenburg.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2382src" href="#xd21e2382" name="xd21e2382src">27</a> It is 27
feet long and scarcely 16 inches wide.</p>
<p>Sir W. Wilde describes several boats from the marshes and peat-bogs
of Ireland,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2387src" href="#xd21e2387" name=
"xd21e2387src">28</a> many of which have handles cut in the wood at the
ends, by the help of which they could easily be dragged along overland.
Sir W. Wilde adds that the Irish also used <i>curraghs</i>, or
<i>coracles</i>, which were mere wicker frames covered with the skins
of oxen. These frail barks introduce us to a new mode of navigation;
they are met with not only in tire different countries of Europe, but
also in America, and were in use there in pre-Columbian times. Even
more interesting examples have been found in Scotland.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2396src" href="#xd21e2396" name=
"xd21e2396src">29</a> Towards the close of last century a pirogue was
taken from the ancient bed of the Clyde at Glasgow. Since then have
been discovered, at depths varying from six to twelve feet, more than
twenty similar boats. The deposits in which they lay had formerly been
beneath the sea, but are now some twenty feet above the level of the
ocean. Great changes have therefore taken place since these barks were
launched upon the waves.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2401src" href=
"#xd21e2401" name="xd21e2401src">30</a> Their mode of construction
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2411" href="#xd21e2411" name=
"xd21e2411">71</a>]</span>is an excellent indication of the date to
which they belong. Some which are hollowed out of the trunks of oaks by
the help of fire, or with a blunt tool, are supposed by Lyell to date
from the Stone age. Others have clean-cut notches, evidently made with
metal implements. Some are made of planks joined together with wooden
pegs, and one canoe found in County Galway even contained copper nails.
Most of the boats from the bed of the Clyde seem to have foundered in
still waters. Some, however, were discovered in a vertical position,
others had the keel uppermost, and these latter had evidently sunk in a
storm. In one of these boats was a diorite hatchet of the kind
characteristic of Neolithic times; another, the wood of which was
perfectly black, had become as hard as marble, and in it was a cork
plug. Then, as now, the oak which yields cork was foreign to the cold
climate of Scotland.</p>
<p>We will quote but one of the discoveries made in England. In 1881 a
canoe, hollowed out of the trunk of a tree, was found at Bovey-Tracey
in Devonshire. It lay in a deposit of brick-earth more than twenty-nine
feet below the highest level reached by the waters of the
Bovey.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2415src" href="#xd21e2415" name=
"xd21e2415src">31</a> It was more than thirty-five inches wide, and its
length could not be exactly determined, the workmen having broken it in
getting it out. An eminent arch&aelig;ologist is of opinion that this
boat dates from the Glacial epoch, perhaps even from a more remote
time. If this hypothesis, the responsibility of which we leave to him,
be correct, this is the most ancient witness in existence of
prehistoric <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2421" href="#xd21e2421"
name="xd21e2421">72</a>]</span>navigation. We must also mention a boat
found near Brigg (Lincolnshire), a few feet from a little river that
flows into the Humber. It is about forty-five feet long by three and a
half feet wide, and is some three feet high. The prow is fluted. There
are no traces of a mast, though the size of the boat must have made it
difficult to manage with oars alone.</p>
<p>One of the pirogues preserved at the Copenhagen Museum is made of
one half of the trunk of a tree, some six feet long, hollowed into the
shape of a trough, and cut straight at both ends.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2426src" href="#xd21e2426" name="xd21e2426src">32</a> It is
curious to compare this clumsy structure with a boat recently
discovered beneath a tumulus at Gogstadten in Norway (<a href=
"#fig014">Fig. 14</a>), of which, though it dates from historic times,
we give a drawing, as it is a good illustration of the progress made.
The dead Viking had been laid in his boat, as the most glorious of
tombs; with its prow pointing seawards, for would not the first
thoughts of the chief when he awoke in another life be of the sea which
had witnessed his triumphs? The sides of the boat, which was more than
sixty-six feet long and fifteen across the widest part, were painted,
and around it was ranged a series of shields lapping over one another
like the scales of a fish, and not unlike the designs seen in the
celebrated Bayeux tapestry. A block of oak intended to receive the mast
was placed in the centre of the boat, and near the skeleton were oars
some fifteen feet long and similar in form to those now in use.</p>

</div>
<p>Inlaying the foundations of the bridge of Les Invalides, Paris, a
boat was taken out of the mud which had lain there for many centuries.
Like most of those <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2442" href=
"#xd21e2442" name="xd21e2442">74</a>]</span>already mentioned, it had
been made out of a single trunk roughly squared. Everywhere, we must
repeat once again, man&rsquo;s original ideas were the same; everywhere
the tree floating on the top of the water excited his curiosity, and
became the starting-point for one of his most important discoveries.
Traces of similar attempts at navigation are met with in other parts of
France; a canoe was found in the Loire near Saint Mars, and the Dijon
Museum possesses another from the same river, the latter some sixteen
feet long, and traces have been made out of what are supposed to have
been seats, but may have been mere contrivances for strengthening the
boat. A canoe taken last year from the bed of the Cher is of the shape
of a trough closed at the end by pieces of wood fixed by means of
vertical grooves. The prow had been shaped in the first instance in the
trunk itself, and it was probably owing to an accident, a collision
perhaps, that it had had to be mended in this way (<a href=
"#fig015">Fig. 15</a>).</p>

<p>The Lake Dwellers of Switzerland owned boats from the time of their
first settlement in their water homes. One of them found at Robenhausen
is more than ten feet long, and is very shallow, varying from six to
eight inches. Like most of those already mentioned, it was hollowed out
of the trunk of a tree, bulging out towards the centre, and rounded at
the ends. So far none but stone tools have been found at the station of
Robenhausen, so that we must presume that it was with such tools that
the boat was made. The lakes of Bienne and. Geneva, and the stations of
Morges and Estavayer have also yielded boats which are doubtless less
ancient than those of which I have just spoken. In nearly all of them
the prow is curiously pointed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2454"
href="#xd21e2454" name="xd21e2454">76</a>]</span>One of them from the
Lake of Neuch&acirc;tel, large enough to bold twelve people, has a beak
at the stern and a rounded prow; but there is no sign of any
contrivance for keeping the oars in place.</p>
<p>Lastly, a boat bas been found in Switzerland some 3,900 feet above
the valley of the Rhine, but no one can say how it came to be at such a
height.</p>

<p>These canoes, whatever their shape or size, can only have been
worked by means of oars, yet oars have seldom been found. The Geneva
Museum, however, has one which came from the muddy bed of an Italian
lake, and others are preserved in the Royal Museum of Dublin, which
have every sign of great antiquity. In de fault of the actual oars, we
have other proofs of their use. Gross<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2465src" href="#xd21e2465" name="xd21e2465src">33</a> mentions a
boat (<a href="#fig016">Fig. 16</a>) in which holes had been made in
the upper parts of the sides to hold the oars. In 1882 a pirogue was
taken out of the bed of the Rhone at Cordon (Ain), which had been half
buried in the mud of the river. The wood was black and the upper
portions were charred, but the middle part <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2474" href="#xd21e2474" name=
"xd21e2474">77</a>]</span>was still intact and very hard. The holes,
pierced in the sides at regular intervals, may have served to keep the
oars in place. The position of the rowers at the bottom of the boat was
very unsatisfactory. It was not, however, until later that we find
seats so placed as to enable the rowers to put out all their strength.
At a recent meeting of the Anthropological Society (July 21, 1887) M.
Letourneau observed that the rudder came into use very slowly. It was
not known to the Egyptians or to the Ph&oelig;nicians, nor, which is
still more strange, to the Greeks and Romans. Their vessels, whatever
their size, were guided by two large oars (<i>gubernaculum</i>) placed
in the stern. The Chinese appear to have been the only people who were
acquainted with the use of the rudder from time immemorial. It is
probable that from them it passed to the Arabs and even perhaps to the
people of Europe.</p>
<p>A discovery made near Abbeville is the most ancient example we have
of the use of the mast. Some works being executed at the fortifications
of the town, brought to light a boat which must have been some
twenty-one feet long. Two projections form part of the planking,
leaving between them a rectangular space in which the mast was probably
fixed.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2481src" href="#xd21e2481" name=
"xd21e2481src">34</a></p>
<p>Professor Gastaldi speaks of a wooden anchor taken from a peat-bog
near Arona, beneath which was a pile dwelling. He dates it from the
tinge when the use of bronze was already beginning to spread in the
north of Italy. A stone of peculiar shape found at Niddau is, they say,
an <i>Ankerstein</i> (anchor stone). This name is also given by Friedel
to a good-sized round lump of sandstone with a deep groove near the
middle. Lastly, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2489" href=
"#xd21e2489" name="xd21e2489">78</a>]</span>Kerviler, in crossing a
basin of the Bay of Penhouet, near Saint-Nazaire, found several stones
which had evidently been used to keep boats at anchor, and with the aid
of which we can get an idea of the methods employed by ancient
navigators (<a href="#fig017">Fig. 17</a>).</p>
<div class="figure xd21e2495width" id="fig017"><img src=

1, 2, 3, stones weighing about 160 pounds each. 4 and 5, lighter
stones, probably used for canoes.</p>
</div>
<p>Such are the only details we have on the important subject of
prehistoric anchors, but we may add that ancient fishermen probably
ventured but a short distance from the land, and would not need
anchors, as they could easily carry their light boats on shore.</p>
<p>We leave now passed in review the conditions of the life of our
remote ancestors, noting the animals that were their contemporaries,
and the fish that peopled the watercourses near which they lived. We
have studied the earliest efforts at navigation, made in the pursuit of
fish, and we must now go back to examine the weapons, tools, and
ornaments of these ancient peoples, and trace in those objects the dawn
of art. This will be the aim of our next chapter. <span class=

<p class="first">The Vedas show us Indra, armed with a wooden club,
seizing a stone with which to pierce Vritra, the genius of
evil.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2513src" href="#xd21e2513" name=
"xd21e2513src">1</a> Does not this call up a picture of the earliest
days of man upon the earth? His first weapon was doubtless a knotty
branch torn from a tree as be hurried past, or a stone picked up from
amongst those lying at his feet. These were, however, but feeble means
with which to contend with formidable feline and pachydermatous
enemies. Man bad not their great physical strength; he was not so fleet
a runner as many of them; his nails and teeth were useless to him,
either for attack or defence; his smooth skin was not enough protection
even from the rigor of the climate. Such inequality must very quickly
have led to the defeat of man, had not God given to him two marvellous
instruments: the brain which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2516"
href="#xd21e2516" name="xd21e2516">80</a>]</span>conceives, and the
hand which executes. To brute force man opposed intelligence, a
glorious struggle in which he was sure to come off victorious, for in
the words of Victor Hugo, &ldquo;Ceci devait tuer cela.&rdquo; The huge
animals of Quaternary times have disappeared for ever, whilst plan has
survived, victor over Nature herself. Even before his birth, an
immutable decree had ordained that nothing on the earth should check
his development.</p>
<p>Man alone amongst the countless creatures around him knew anything
of the past, and he alone was able to predict the future. Even apes,
however great the intelligence that may be attributed to them, have
remained very much what they were from the first. In vain has one
generation succeeded another; they still obey the dictates of their
brutal instincts, as their ancestors did before them; and if apes
continue to propagate their species thousands of years hence they will
remain what we see them to be now. Dogs, too, will remain dogs,
elephants will continue to be elephants; beavers will make their dams
exactly like those of the present day, wasps will never learn to make
honey as bees do, and bees will never be able, like ants, to bring up
plant-lice to be their servants, or to enslave other families. Their
instincts are incapable of progress, and in their earliest efforts they
reach the limit assigned to them by the Eternal Wisdom. To man alone
has it been given to understand what has been done by his predecessors,
to walk more firmly in the path along which they groped, to pronounce
clearly the words they stammered. Without a doubt we descend from the
men who lived in the midst of primeval forests, or amongst stagnant
marshes, dwelling <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2520" href=
"#xd21e2520" name="xd21e2520">81</a>]</span>in caves, for the
possession of which they often bad to fight with the wild beasts around
them. These men, however, knew that one result achieved would lead to
another, if similar means were used; they saw that a pointed stone
would inflict a deeper wound than a blunt one on the animal they
hunted, and therefore they learnt to sharpen stones artificially; the
skins of beasts, flung over their shoulders, protected them from cold,
and they learned to make garments; seeds sprouted around them, and they
learned to plant them; they noticed the effect of heat upon metals, and
tried to mix them; wild animals wandered around them, and they learned
to reduce them to slavery. Every bit of knowledge won, and every
progress made, became the starting-point for fresh acquisitions, fresh
advances, which thenceforth remained forever the common heritage of the
human race.</p>
<p>It was thus that experience early taught our remote ancestors that
rock chips more easily under the blows of a hammer when fresh from the
quarry; and everywhere men learnt to choose the stone best suited to
their purpose. For hatchets, wedges, and hammers, they used jade and
kindred substances, such as fibrolite, diorite, and basalt, which were
at the same time extremely durable, and very impervious to blows. For
spear- and arrow-heads, knives, saws, and all instruments requiring
sharp points and cutting edges, they employed quartz, jaspar, agate,
and obsidian, according to the situation of the worker; all these
materials, though extremely hard, being easily split into thin sharp
flakes. The blocks of stone were very methodically cut up; they were,
in fact, to use a very appropriate expression of M. Dupont&rsquo;s,
scaled (<i lang="fr">&eacute;caill&ecirc;s</i>). We <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2527" href="#xd21e2527" name=

(Figs. <a href="#fig018">18</a>, <a href="#fig019">19</a>, and <a href=
"#fig020">20</a>), which illustrate the earliest efforts of lean,
efforts which may be looked upon as the starting-point of all those
industries which in the course of centuries have developed results
which it is impossible to contemplate without astonishment.</p>

<p>The host ancient tools which have come down to us were clumsy and
heavy, cut on both sides and pointed (<a href="#fig020">Fig. 20</a>).
They may vary in material, in size, and in finish, but they can always
be easily recognized.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2553src" href=
"#xd21e2553" name="xd21e2553src">2</a> Were they man&rsquo;s only

Saint-Acheul, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2573" href=

of these strange discoveries, the almond shape is found mixed with the
pointed amongst the Moustier flints, so that what is true in one place
is not in another, and any general conclusion would certainly be
premature.</p>

<p>It would take us a long time to enumerate the countries where tools
of the Chell&eacute;en<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2582src" href=
"#xd21e2582" name="xd21e2582src">4</a> type have been found. They are
met with in the valleys of the rivers of France, now imbedded in the
flinty alluvium, now strewn upon the surface of the soil. Though rare
in Germany, they are found in abundance in the southeast of England,
and it is to this period that must be assigned the discoveries at
Hoxne, and in the basins of the Thames, the Ouse, and the Avon. Similar
discoveries have been frequent in Italy, Spain, Algeria, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2590" href="#xd21e2590" name=
"xd21e2590">84</a>]</span>and Hindostan. Dr. Abbott speaks of the
finding of such implements in the glacial alluvium of the Delaware
(Figs. <a href="#fig018">18</a> and <a href="#fig019">19</a>), Miss
Babitt in the alluvial deposits of the Mississippi, Mr. Haynes in New
Hampshire, Mr. Holmes in Colombia, and other explorers in the basin of
the Bridget and at Guanajuato in Mexico. Everywhere these implements
are identical in shape and in mode of construction, and very often they
are associated with the bones of animals of extinct species.</p>
<p>Sometimes these Chell&eacute;en tools (the French call them <i>coups
de poing</i>) have retained at the base a projection to enable the user
to grasp them better; these certainly never had handles, but it will
not do to draw any general conclusions froth that fact; and an
examination of the collection of M. d&rsquo;Acy, the most complete we
have of relics of the Chell&eacute;en period, proves on the contrary
that certain tools could not have been used unless they had been fixed
into handles.</p>
<p>In the following epoch, to which has been given the name of
Moust&eacute;rien, from the Moustier Cave (Dordogne), we already meet
with more varied forms, including scrapers, saws, knife-blades, and
spear- or arrow-heads, with the special characteristic of being cut on
one side only. These implements are found not only in the alluvium as
are the Chell&eacute;en <i>coups de poing</i>, but also in the cave or
rock-shelter deposits. Amongst the mammalian remains with which they
are associated are those of the mammoth, the <i lang="la">Rhinoceros
tichorhinus</i>, the elk, the horse, the aurochs, the cave-lion, the
cave-hyena, and the cave-bear, remarkable for the constancy of their
characteristics. The <i lang="la">Elephas antiquus</i> and the
<i>Rhinoceros Merckii</i> that belonged to the preceding period have
now completely passed away, and the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e2618" href="#xd21e2618" name="xd21e2618">85</a>]</span>reindeer,
now appearing for the first time, are still far from numerous.</p>
<p>In the Solutr&eacute;en period, so named after the celebrated Lake
Station of Solutr&eacute;, we find stalked arrow-heads with lateral
notches,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2622src" href="#xd21e2622" name=
"xd21e2622src">5</a> flint-heads of the form of laurel leaves, which
are remarkable for their regularity of shape and delicacy of finish; as
compared with those of previous periods, the forms are much more
delicate and elegant. Many of the caves of the south of France belong
to this period. It is difficult to mention them all, and even more
difficult to make out a complete list of contemporary mammalia; the
deposits generally actually touch those of another period, and the
separation of the objects in them has not always been made with all the
care that could be wished. At Solutr&eacute;, remains of the horse
predominate; whilst in other places those of the reindeer are met with
in considerable quantities, and with them are found the bones of the
cave-bear, the wild cat (a creature considerably larger than the tigers
of the present day), and of the mammoth, which lived on in Europe many
centuries.</p>
<p>Lastly to the Madeleine period, so named after the Madeleine Cave
(Dordogne), and considered one of the most important of the cave
epochs, belong tools and weapons of all manner of shapes and materials,
including bone, born, and reindeer antlers; from this time also date
barbed arrows and harpoons, batons of office, telling of social
organization; the engravings and carvings on which bear witness to the
development of artistic feeling. On the other hand, the flint
arrow-heads and knife-blades are not so finely cut; we see that man had
learned to use other materials than stone. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2627" href="#xd21e2627" name=
"xd21e2627">86</a>]</span>The reindeer is the most characteristic
animal form of the Madeleine period.</p>
<p>To the times we have just passed in review succeeded others of a
very different kind, to which has been given the general naive of
Neolithic. The fauna, probably lender the influence of climatic and
orographic changes, underwent a complete transformation; the mammoth,
the cave-bear, the megaceros, and the large felid&aelig; died out, the
hippopotamus was no longer seen, except in the heart of Africa; the
reindeer and other mammals that love to frequent the regions of
perpetual snow, retired to the extreme north; and in their place
appeared our earliest domestic animals, the ox, the sheep, the goat,
and the dog. Man, who witnessed these changes, continued to progress;
he abandoned his nomad for a sedentary life; he ceased to be a bunter,
and became an agriculturist and a shepherd. Everywhere we meet with
traces of new customs, new ideas, and a new mode of life. This progress
is especially seen in the industrial arts. Metals it is true are still
unknown, but side by side with tools, which are merely chipped or
roughly cut, we find for the first time hatchets, celts, small
knife-blades, and arrow-heads admirably polished by the long-continued
rubbing of one stone on another. Polishers, so much worn as to bear
witness to long service, are numerous in all collections, and rocks and
erratic blocks retain incisions which must have been used for the same
purpose.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2631src" href="#xd21e2631" name=
"xd21e2631src">6</a></p>
<p>It is impossible to enumerate the number of polished hatchets which
have been found; their number is simply incalculable. Of all of them,
however, those of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2636" href=
"#xd21e2636" name="xd21e2636">87</a>]</span>Scandinavia are the most
remarkable for delicacy of workmanship. With the fine hatchets of
Brittany, may be compared the blades found at Volgu, and preserved in
the Museum of Copenhagen, and those in pink, gray, and brown flint,
from the Sordes Cave in the south of France; but we cannot fix the date
of the production of any of them. One of the great difficulties of
prehistoric research, a difficulty not to be got over in the present
state of our knowledge, is to distinguish with any certainty the
periods into which an attempt has been made to divide the life-story of
man from his first appearance upon earth.</p>
<p>Was there any abrupt transition from one period to another? Must we
accept the theory of a long break caused by geological phenomena, and
the temporary depopulation which was one of the consequences of these
phenomena? Did the new era of civilization date from the arrival of
foreign races, stronger and better fitted than those they succeeded for
the struggle for existence? Or are these changes merely the result of
the natural progress which is one of the laws of our being? These
questions cannot now be solved, and if the industries which are at the
present moment the object of our researches, bear witness to the
employment of a new process, that of polishing, we are bound to add
that everywhere Paleolithic forms are still persistent. Flints, merely
chipped, are clumsy tools, but there is no break in their series till
we come to the splendid specimens from Scandinavia or from Mexico. Of
the seven types of the Solutr&eacute;en period, six are met with in the
time now under consideration.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2640src" href=
"#xd21e2640" name="xd21e2640src">7</a> Five types of Solutr&eacute;en
javelins have also been found in the Durfort <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2646" href="#xd21e2646" name=
"xd21e2646">88</a>]</span>Cave, and beneath the dolmens of Aveyron and
of Loz&egrave;re. Neolithic weapons, such as those found in the
Moustier Cave, are not so numerous, but the type adopted there is not
such a fine one nor so carefully finished, which accounts for its
having been more rarely copied. If we examine the knives, awls,
scrapers, and saws, we come to the same conclusion, although comparison
is not so easy. &ldquo;A knife is always a knife, an awl is always an
awl,&rdquo; remarks M. Cartailhac; &ldquo;they were made at every
period, and their resemblance to each other proves nothing with any
certainty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rounded stones of granite or sandstone seem however to have been
weapons peculiar to the Neolithic period. Dr. Pommerol recently spoke
at the Anthropological Society of Paris, of two such rounded stones
picked up in the Puy-de-D&ocirc;me. Similar stones have been discovered
at Viry-Noureuil, and M. Mass&eacute;nat has one in his collection from
Chez-Pourr&eacute;. Are not these rounded stones of a similar character
to the <i>bolas</i> flung by the ancient Gauls, and still in use
amongst the inhabitants of the pampas of South America?</p>
<p>As we have already remarked, plan from the earliest times must often
have held in his hands the stones which served him as weapons or as
tools. The marks of hammering on the smooth surfaces, the rounded
projections and the grooves worked in these stones, were evidently made
to prevent the hand or the thumb from slipping. Soon, however,
reflection led man to understand the increase of force he would gain by
the addition to the stone of a handle of wood or horn, stag or reindeer
antler. This addition of a handle was simple enough: the workman merely
bound it to the hatchet with fibrous roots, leather thongs, or
ligaments <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2655" href="#xd21e2655"
name="xd21e2655">89</a>]</span>taken from the gut of the animals slain
in the chase (<a href="#fig021">Fig. 21</a>). At first sight we are
astonished at the results obtained with such wretched materials, but it
is impossible to dispute them, for we have seen the same thing done in
our own day.</p>

<p class="first">1. Stone javelin-head with handle. 2. Stone hatchet

</div>
<p>Other hatchets, chiefly those of a small size, were fixed into
sheaths made of stag-horn, and two chief types of them have actually
been made out.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2667src" href="#xd21e2667"
name="xd21e2667src">8</a> The sheaths of the first type are short and
end in quadrangular beads. They are found most frequently in
Switzerland, in the basins of the Rhone and of the Sa&ocirc;ne, and
throughout the south of France. Those of the second type are pierced
with a hole large enough to pass the handle through. These are found in
the northwest of France, in Belgium, and in England. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2670" href="#xd21e2670" name=
"xd21e2670">90</a>]</span></p>
<p>Flint arrows of triangular or oval form, notched or stalked, were
everywhere used for a considerable length of time. They are found in
the numerous caves of France, beneath the <i>antas</i> of Portugal, in
the tombs of Myken&aelig;, as well as among the A&iuml;nos of Japan and
the Patagonians of South America. Their use necessarily involves that
of a bow, yet we do not know of a single weapon such as that, or of one
that could take its place, dating from Paleolithic times. Probably the
rapid decomposition of the wood of which bows were made has led to
their disappearance. De Mortillet<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2676src"
href="#xd21e2676" name="xd21e2676src">9</a> mentions a bow found in a
pile-dwelling in a bog near Robenhausen, which he ascribes to the
Neolithic period. Another is known which was found at Lutz, also in
Switzerland. To all appearance the most ancient bows of historic times
greatly resemble these two prehistoric examples.</p>
<p>Though flint was the material par excellence of Quaternary times for
weapons and tools, it could not long suffice for the ever-growing needs
of man. Our museums contain a complete series of bone or stag-horn
implements such as darts, arrow-heads, barbed arrows, harpoons,
fibul&aelig;, and finely cut needles often pierced with eyes (<a href=
"#fig022">Fig. 22</a>). The invention of barbs is worthy of special
notice; the series of points made the blow much more dangerous, as the
projectile remained in the flesh of a wounded animal which was not able
to get it out. But this was not the only object of the barbs. Arranged
symmetrically on either side of the arrow they kept it afloat in the
air like the wings of a bird, which may perhaps have suggested their
use and increased the effect and precision of the shot.</p>

<p>The Marsoulas Cave has yielded one bevelled arrow shaft, made of
reindeer antler, with a deep groove on the surface. A similar
arrow-head was found in the Pacard Cave, and in other places arrows
have been found with one or more grooves on the surface. Were these
grooves or drills intended to hold poison, and was man already
acquainted with this melancholy Diode of destruction? We know that the
use of poison was known at the most remote historic antiquity.<a class=

<p>There is no doubt that it is the caves of the south of France which
have yielded the most interesting objects; needles with drilled eyes,
and barbed arrows have been picked up in considerable numbers at
Eyzi&egrave;s, Laugerie-Basse, at Bruniquel, Massat, and in the
Madeleine Cave. Dr. Garrigou mentions some rein deer or roebuck antlers
found in Ari&egrave;ge caves, which had been made into regular
stilettos. In the deposits at Lafaye were fouled stilettos or bodkins,
varying in length from two to six inches; needles measuring from
nineteen to one hundred and five millimetres and provided with eyes; at
Marsoulas were found <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2709" href=

their workmanship, and the drawings with which they were adorned.</p>

</div>
<p>At Paviland, Dr. Buckland discovered a wolf bone cut to a point.
Kent&rsquo;s Hole yielded a number of needles resembling those of the
Madeleine Cave; at Aggtelek (Hungary) were found some bones of the
cave-bear pointed to serve as daggers, cut into scrapers or pierced to
serve as amulets or ornaments. In Belgium, objects very similar to
these have been found made of reindeer antler and dating from the most
remote times. The antlers moulted by the reindeer in the spring were in
especial request.</p>
<p>Excavations in the sepulchral mounds near San Francisco (California)
have yielded thousands of bone implements (<a href="#fig024">Fig.
24</a>). Others similar to them have been found in the layers of
cinders at Madisonville <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2726" href=
"#xd21e2726" name="xd21e2726">94</a>]</span>(Ohio) and beneath the
numerous kitchen-middings of the coasts of the Atlantic and
Pacific.</p>
<p>The processes employed by the cave-men were very simple. In one of
the excavations superintended by him, M. Dupont<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2730src" href="#xd21e2730" name="xd21e2730src">11</a> picked up
the radius of a horse bearing symmetrically made incisions executed
with a view to getting off splinters of the bone. These splinters were
rounded by rubbing either with chips of flint, or on such polishers as
are to be seen in any of the museums; then one end was sharpened, and
the other, if need were, pierced with a hole. It is astonishing to find
some of them as fine as the steel needles of the present day, and with
perfectly round eyes made with the help of nothing but a rough flint,
and there would still be some doubt on the subject, if M.
Lartet<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2733src" href="#xd21e2733" name=
"xd21e2733src">12</a> had not obtained exactly similar results by
working on fragments of bone with the flints he had fouled in these
excavations. Other experiments of a similar kind were no less
conclusive, for Merk<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2736src" href=
"#xd21e2736" name="xd21e2736src">13</a> perforated all ivory plaque
with a pointed flint which he used as a gimlet.</p>
<p>Some objects, which are supposed to date from Neolithic times, bear
witness to an altogether unexpected degree of civilization. In the
heart of Germany, in the peat-bogs of Laybach and W&ouml;rbzig on the
banks of the Saale, have been found earthenware spoons of the shape of
modern spatul&aelig;; at Geraffin on Lake Bienne, a finely shaped spoon
made of the wood of a yew tree; and at Lagozza, another in shining
black earthenware. Lartet had already brought to light a bone implement
covered with ornaments in relief which <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e2743" href="#xd21e2743" name="xd21e2743">95</a>]</span>he
ascribed to the Pal&aelig;olithic period, and which he imagined had
been used for extracting marrow; and another arch&aelig;ologist tells
of objects in reindeer antler found in the Gourdan Cave, which he
thinks were used for a similar purpose. In the Saint-Germain Museum are
preserved the remains of spoons from the bed of the Seine, and in the
collections of England are fragments of bone taken from beneath the
West-Kennet dolmen, which were all probably employed for extracting
marrow. But the most important discovery of all, which leaves no doubt
on the subject, is that made by M. Perrault at the Chassey Camp, near
Chalon-sur-Sa&ocirc;ne, beneath a hearth dating from Neolithic times.
He collected fourteen earthenware spoons; one of them of a round shape
and remarkable for its size, was unfortunately broken (<a href=
"#fig025">Fig. 25</a>). It is of brown earthenware with a rather rough
surface mixed with bits of flint, and is so much worn that it had
evidently been in use a long time. Lastly two spoons, also of
earthenware, have recently been found <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e2748" href="#xd21e2748" name="xd21e2748">96</a>]</span>near
Dondas (Lot-et-Garonne). The use of spoons, which certainly marked
considerable progress, must therefore have spread rapidly.</p>

<p>Long previously, however, pottery of a great variety of form bore
witness to tire plastic skill of man. Every where we find vessels of
coarse material mixed with grains of sand or mica to give more
consistency to the paste which was baked in the fire, and had often no
further ornamentation than the marks of the fingers of the potter. Does
this pottery date from Pal&aelig;olithic times, or were the earthenware
vessels later additions at the time of those disturbances of deposits
which are the despair of arch&aelig;ologists? A few examples may enable
us better to answer this question.</p>
<p>Fraas tells us that fragments of pottery have been found in all the
caves of Germany in which excavations have been made. He quotes that of
Hohlefels, where he himself picked up such fragments amongst the bones
of the mastodon, the mammoth, the rhinoceros, and the cave-lion, when
the remains of these animals were for the first time found in Germany.
In 1872, the making of the railway from Nuremberg to Ratisbon brought
to light a cave of considerable depth. In its lower deposits were found
nothing but the bones of hyenas, bears, and lions, of which the cave
had been the resort for centuries. Among the most ancient deposits,
relics of a similar kind were found in abundance, but now mixed with
numerous fragments of pottery, worked flints, and fish bones, including
those of the carp and the pike, with the bones of mammals, amongst
which predominated those of the rhinoceros, most of them intentionally
split open. At Argecilla, twenty leagues from Madrid, Vilanova
discovered a regular workshop, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2762"
href="#xd21e2762" name="xd21e2762">97</a>]</span>in which were knives
and flint arrow-heads, together with some very primitive pottery made
of clay that had evidently been brought from a distance, as there is
none in the district in which the pottery was found, In an upper
deposit Vilanova collected more than two hundred implements made of
diorite, a rock frequently used in Spain, some very remarkable celts of
serpentine dating from the Neolithic period, and numerous fragments of
very delicate pottery. Not far off he discovered another workshop,
containing some very fine hatchets perfectly polished, and some keramic
ware tastily ornamented. The progress made is as marked in the weapons
and tools as in the pottery.</p>
<p>We have also seen some fragments of earthenware from the caves of
Chiampo and Laglio, near Lake Como, and from that known as the Cave dei
Colombi, in tire island of Palmaria, which was occupied shortly before
the Neolithic period. But it is Belgium which yields the most decisive
proof on this subject, and a visit to the Brussels Museum is enough to
convince the most incredulous. The excavations made under M. Dupont in
the caves of the Meuse and the Lesse have again and again brought to
light fragments of pottery, associated with the bones of
Pal&aelig;olithic animals. Schmerling, too, had already found similar
fragments in the Engis Cave, mixed with flint weapons of the rudest
description; and his discoveries have been strikingly confirmed by
those recently made at Spy, near Namur,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2766src" href="#xd21e2766" name="xd21e2766src">14</a> and by
others made by M. Fraipont.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2772src" href=
"#xd21e2772" name="xd21e2772src">15</a> In portions of this same Engis
Cave not previously explored the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e2778" href="#xd21e2778" name="xd21e2778">98</a>]</span>learned
professor of Li&egrave;ge found, in 1887, fragments of a vase of ovoid
form, some flints of the Moust&eacute;rien type, and some bones of
extinct mammals. Most of the pottery in the Brussels Museum is black
and of primitive make; some few fragments, however, are of finished
workmanship. We may mention especially an ovoid vase, remarkable for
its size and for its lateral projections. This vase, which is
hand-modelled, came from the Frontal Cave; the clay is of blackish hue
mixed with little bits of calcareous spar. M. Ordinaire, Vice-Consul
for France at Callao, speaks of the <i>cayanes</i> or <i>macahuas</i>,
which are earthenware basins of great symmetry of form, made by the
Combos women, without turning wheels or mills of any kind. Though the
elegant shape of the Frontal and other vases at first surprises us,
reflection convinces us that men who could cut stones with such rare
skill would certainly be able to produce equally good pottery.</p>

<p class="first">Pottery of a so far unclassified type found in the

</div>
<p>Similar instances may easily be quoted from France. Excavations at
Solutr&eacute; have yielded several fragments of yellow, hand-made
pottery very insufficiently baked; and other pieces have been found in
the peat-bogs of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2793" href=
"#xd21e2793" name="xd21e2793">99</a>]</span>Bastide de B&eacute;arn
with the bones of reindeer, and worked flints similar to those found in
Quaternary deposits. We may add that at Lafaye, Bize, and Pondre
(Hainault) discoveries were made of pottery mixed with human remains
and with those of animals now extinct; and in the Argent Cave
(Basses-Alpes) a new type, shown in <a href="#fig026">Fig. 26</a>, has
been found which merits special attention. In the very earliest days of
prehistoric research the Nabrigas Cave (Loz&egrave;re) was excavated by
M. Joly, who found in it many fragments of pottery. In a volume
published shortly before his death he relates the circumstances of his
discovery, and earnestly maintains its authenticity. Later excavations,
made under the direction of masters in prehistoric science, would have
thrown some doubts on the assertions made by the professor of Toulouse,
if MM. Martel and Launay had not brought forward a fresh proof in
support of it. &ldquo;On the 30th August, 1885,&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2798src" href="#xd21e2798" name=
"xd21e2798src">16</a> they say, &ldquo;we picked up at Nabrigas in a
deep hole, untouched by previous excavations and not displaced by
water, some human bones and a piece of pottery side by side with two
skeletons of <i>Ursus spel&aelig;us</i>. The human bones, of
indeterminate race, included an upper left maxillary, still retaining
three teeth, an incomplete mastoid apophysis, and seven pieces of
crania, belonging to different individuals. The piece of pottery only
measured one and a half by two and a quarter inches; the clay is gray
and friable, bound together with big bits of quartz, mica, and a few
particles of charcoal.&rdquo; There would appear to be no sufficient
reason to question the exactness of a discovery so carefully studied.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2806" href="#xd21e2806" name=
"xd21e2806">100</a>]</span></p>
<p>Many eminent arch&aelig;ologists, however, maintain that pottery was
completely unknown in Paleolithic times, and they do not hesitate to
attribute to a later period any deposit in which it occurs where its
presence cannot be accounted for by later displacements. M. Cartailhac
declares that he has never been able to establish either in the south
of France or in the central table-land a single fact which justifies us
in asserting that the men of the Reindeer period, still less those of
earlier epochs, knew how to make pottery. The first explorers, he adds,
did not always distinguish with sufficient care the vestiges of
different epochs, the relics of diverse origins. How often have bones
carried along by water, or brought where they are found by animals,
been mixed with those abandoned by men, or the deposits of the
Neolithic period with those of the earliest Quaternary times! How often
have the contents of a passage giving access to a cave been confounded
with those of the cave itself! Hence deplorable errors, which it is
impossible to rectify now. Evans and Geikie in their turn assert the
absence in England<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2809src" href=
"#xd21e2809" name="xd21e2809src">17</a> of Pal&aelig;olithic pottery,
and Sir J. Lubbock energetically maintains this opinion.</p>
<p>Doubtless these are great authorities, and yet, in view of the facts
now known, it is difficult to believe that man was long a stranger to
the art of making pottery. Its invention required no great effort of
intelligence, and its fabrication presented no great difficulties. Man
had but to knead the soft clay <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2814"
href="#xd21e2814" name="xd21e2814">101</a>]</span>which he trod under
his foot, and the plasticity of which he could not fail to notice. This
clay hardened in the sun, and hollows were formed as it
shrunk&mdash;the first vessel was discovered! Experience soon taught
man to replace the heat of the sun by that of the fire, and to add a
few bits of some hard substance to give the clay greater consistency.
These first crude and clumsy vases have been preserved to our own day
as irrefutable witnesses to the work of our ancestors. Though,
therefore, we cannot be sure that pottery was made in Quaternary times
by all the races that peopled Europe,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2816src" href="#xd21e2816" name="xd21e2816src">18</a> it is
impossible to deny that a great many of them were in possession of the
art. This difference in the degree of civilization attained to by men
living but short distances from each other need not surprise us, for
all travellers report similar facts amongst contemporary savage
races.</p>
<p>The baking of pottery is a proof that the use of fire was known in
the most remote times. The existence in various places of masses of
cinders, fragments of charred wood, and half-calcined bones, proves it
yet more decidedly. At Solutr&eacute;, at Louvern&eacute; (Mayenne), at
Saint-Florent (Corsica), to give but a few examples, we find large
slabs of half-calcined stone, laid flat and covered with heaps of
cinders and all sorts of rubbish. These slabs formed the family hearth,
where man prepared his food, with the help of the fire he had learnt to
ignite and to keep burning.</p>
<p>How did man arrive at a discovery so vital to his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2823" href="#xd21e2823" name=
"xd21e2823">102</a>]</span>existence? The Vedas assign the origin of
fire to the rubbing together in a storm of the dry branches of trees.
&ldquo;The first men,&rdquo; says Vitruvius,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2825src" href="#xd21e2825" name="xd21e2825src">19</a> &ldquo;were
born, as were other animals, in the forests, caves, and woods. The
thick trees violently agitated by the storm took fire, through the
rubbing together of their branches; the fury of the flames terrified
the men who found themselves near them and made them take to flight.
Soon reassured, however, they gradually approached again and realized
all the advantages they might gain for their bodies from the gentle
warmth of the fire. They added fuel to the flames, they kept the fire
up, they fetched other men whom they made understand by signs all the
usefulness of this discovery. The men thus assembled articulated a few
sounds, which, repeated every day, accidentally formed certain words
which served to designate objects, and soon they had a language which
enabled them to speak and to understand one another. It was, then, the
discovery of fire which led men to come together to form a society, to
live together, and to inhabit the same places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without pausing to consider the somewhat puerile theories of
Vitruvius, or the myths which testify to the importance attached to
fire by primeval man, we are at liberty to suppose that a conflagration
caused by lightning or by the spontaneous combustion of vegetable
materials in a state of fermentation, or other similar phenomena, made
known to man the power of fire, and the use it might be to him. The
accidental striking together of two flints produced a spark;
observation taught men to obtain a similar result by the same process;
a great step in advance was made, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e2833" href="#xd21e2833" name="xd21e2833">103</a>]</span>the
future of humanity was assured. M. Dupont picked up in the Chaleux Cave
a kidney-shaped piece of iron pyrites, hollowed out in a peculiar
manner, which had evidently been used to obtain the precious spark. The
Christy collection contains a granite pebble with a hole the shape of a
cup, which had evidently been used to obtain fire, by rubbing round in
it a stick of very dry wood. The two methods employed at the present
day were therefore already in use. Lumholz tells us that the
Australians of Herbert River get fire by rubbing two pieces of wood
together. The Indians of the northwest of Colorado, the Yapais of the
Caroline Islands, and the Mincopies of the Andaman Isles, with many
other races, know no other process. We must, however, still maintain a
certain reserve in dealing with the fire-obtaining implements of so
imperfect a nature, and belonging to times so remote as those called
prehistoric.</p>
<p>During bad seasons, or in the bitter cold of winter, primeval man
contented himself with flinging over his shoulders the skins of the
animals he had killed. He prepared these skins with flint scrapers, and
sewed them together with bone needles. In hot weather man probably
roamed about stark naked. Shame is not a natural instinct; education
alone develops it. Writing in 1617, Fynes Morison speaks of having seen
at Cork young girls quite naked, engaged in crushing corn with a stone.
The Tchoutchi women, says Nordenski&ouml;ld, wear no clothes when in
their tents, however great the cold. In tropical countries men, women,
and children, all completely nude, went to meet the travellers who
landed on their shores. Count Ursel, in a recent journey in Bolivia, in
going through a little town, saw &ldquo;near the public fountain some
young girls already <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2837" href=
"#xd21e2837" name="xd21e2837">104</a>]</span>growing up making their
ablutions and playing about in the garb of the earthly paradise.&rdquo;
Travellers who visited Japan a few years ago reported that the
inhabitants, without distinction of age or sex, came out of the water
in a state of complete nudity, presenting a strange spectacle to
European eyes. The sight of what is actually going on amongst
comparatively civilized people in our own day enables us to understand
better what must have been the state of things when the whole world was
in a state of barbarism.</p>
<p>It was not until much later, in the times to which the name of
Neolithic has been given, that men made stuffs, and replaced the skins
of animals by lighter and more flexible garments. The inhabitants of
the Lake Stations of Switzerland and of Italy cultivated hemp. At
Wangen and at Robenhausen have been found shreds of coarsely woven
cloth, and at Lagozza fragments of yet more primitive material. On some
of these pieces it is supposed that traces of fringe and attempts at
ornamentation have been made out. Even in the P&eacute;rigord caves
Lartet noticed some long slim needles which could not have been used
for sewing skins; and he concluded that they were intended for more
delicate work, perhaps even for embroidery. A new art, and one which we
certainly should not have expected to find is now met with for the
first time.</p>
<p>It is probable that our savage ancestors tatooed themselves, or
painted their bodies, as did the Britons in the time of C&aelig;sar,
and as do modern savages, or, not to go so far afield, as do English
sailors and some of the workingmen of France.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2844src" href="#xd21e2844" name="xd21e2844src">20</a> At
Montastruc <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2847" href="#xd21e2847"
name="xd21e2847">105</a>]</span>have been picked up some fragments of
red chalk, and in Mayenne of red iron ore, whilst in the cave of Spy
was found a bone filled with a very fine red powder, and in that of
Saltp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re some powder of the same kind was discovered
preserved from destruction in a shell. Lartet and Christy have made
similar discoveries in the caves of the Dordogne; M. Dupont in a
shelter at Chaleux, and M. Rivi&egrave;re at
Baouss&eacute;-Rouss&eacute;. The Abb&eacute; Bourgeois found at
Villehonneur not only a piece of red chalk as big as a nut, but also an
oval-shaped pebble, which had been used for grinding it, the
interstices of the surface still retaining traces of coloring
matter.</p>
<p>Red chalk was not the only substance employed. At Chatelperron, were
picked up fragments of manganese; at Cueva de Rocca, near Valentia,
pieces of cinnabar; in the Placard Cave, bits of black lead; and in the
different stations in the Pyrenees, especially in that of Aurensan,
ochre has been found which was doubtless used for the same purpose. At
Solutr&eacute;, ochre, manganese, and graphite were found; the last
named had been scraped with a flint, and the scratches made by it are
still distinctly visible. From a Westphalian cave, Schaafhausen took
some dark yellow ochre; at Castern (Staffordshire), a bit of this same
calcareous substance, worn with long service, was picked tip; in
Cantire (Argyleshire), a piece of red hematite, which had evidently
been brought from Westmoreland or Lancashire; and lastly, in
Kent&rsquo;s Hole was found some peroxide of manganese.</p>
<p>All these fragments of ochre or manganese, red chalk or black lead,
were reduced to powder with the help of pebbles, artificially hollowed
out. Everywhere <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2853" href=
"#xd21e2853" name="xd21e2853">106</a>]</span>we meet with these
primitive mortars, and side by side with them other pebbles in their
native condition, which had evidently been used for crushing the
coloring matter.</p>
<p>A recent discovery tends to confirm the hypothesis that these colors
were used for the decoration of the human body. A curious engraving on
a bone represents the head and arm of a man, and on the lower part of
the forearm it is easy to make out a four-sided design which evidently
indicated tatooing.</p>
<p>In every country, and in every climate, we find men as well as women
manifesting a taste for ornament. The progress of civilization has
greatly increased this taste, but it existed as a natural instinct in
the very earliest days of humanity, and the contemporary of the mammoth
and the cave-bear, the cave-man cowering in his miserable den, sought
for ornaments with which to deck himself. In the caves near the
stations occupied by primeval men we find little bits of fossil coral,
beads of hardened clay, the teeth of bears, wolves, and foxes,
boars&rsquo; tusks, and the jawbones of small mammals, fish-bones, and
belemnites pierced with holes, and intended to be used as amulets or
ornaments to be worn round the neck. At Lafaye, we find the incisors of
small rodents serving the same purpose. The dweller in the Sordes Cave
owned a precious necklace made of forty bears&rsquo; and three
lions&rsquo; teeth. The teeth found often have on them ornamental
lines, which doubtless indicated the rank or celebrated the deeds of
the chief. The Abb&eacute; Bourgeois describes some stags&rsquo; teeth
found at Villehonneur (Charente), two of which bore scratches which may
have had some signification. At Cro-Magnon were picked up some ivory
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2859" href="#xd21e2859" name=
"xd21e2859">107</a>]</span>plaques pierced with three holes; at
Kent&rsquo;s bole were found some oval disks measuring five by three
inches, which in the delicacy of their workmanship presented a curious
contrast to the other objects taken from the same cave. In the Belgian
caves here picked up some thin slices of jet and some ivory plaques,
and in those of the south of France fragments of steatite, cut into
rectangular and lozenge shapes, whilst in the Thayngen Cave was found a
pendant of lignite (<a href="#fig027">Fig. 27</a>). Men were not
content with natural products; fashion demanded new forms and fresh
materials.</p>

</div>
<p>But what most attracted the attention of the ancient inhabitants of
France were bright-colored shells. The caves of Roquemaure have yielded
nearly a thousand disks and beads made of cockle-shells; at Cro-Magnon
more than three hundred shells were picked up which formed a collar or
necklace, which was not however so valuable as that of the man of
Sordes. M. de Maret discovered at Placard numerous shells; some
belonging to ocean species still extant, and others fossils of forms
now extinct. Many of them are foreign to the country in which they were
found. From the most remote times therefore the inhabitants of the
present department of Charente fished in the Gulf of Gascony,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2871" href="#xd21e2871" name=
"xd21e2871">108</a>]</span>crossed Aquitania, visited the shell marl
deposits of Anjou and Touraine, and penetrated as far as the present
Paris basin. The finding of the <i>Cyprina Islandica</i> in one of the
French caves proves that the prehistoric men of France even went as far
away as the north of England. This is by no means an isolated fact;
numerous shells from the department of Champagne had been taken to tire
shores of the Lesse and the Meuse. At Solutr&eacute; have been found
belemnites, ammonites, and Miocene shells, which were certainly never
native to that district, with pieces of rock-crystal from the Alps, and
beads made of a jadeite of unknown origin.</p>
<p>In Scotland have been found necklaces of nerites and limpets; at
Aurignac, eighteen little plaques of cockle shell pierced with holes in
the centre. At Laugerie-Basse, a man overtaken by a landslip had been
crushed by the stones which had fallen upon him; time has destroyed his
clothes, but the shells with which he had decked himself are still
preserved.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2878src" href="#xd21e2878" name=
"xd21e2878src">21</a> He had worn four on his forehead, two on each
shoulder, four on each knee, and two on each foot. All idea of these
shells having formed a necklace must be abandoned; they were all
notched, and had been used either to adorn or fasten the clothes.</p>
<p>The most interesting discoveries, however, were those made in the
caves of Baouss&eacute;-Rouss&eacute;, of which we have so often
spoken. M. Rivi&egrave;re picked up the skeletons of two children, some
thousand shells (<i>Nassa neritea</i>) artificially pierced, which had
been used to deck their garments: Near an adult were other shells
forming a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2888" href="#xd21e2888"
name="xd21e2888">109</a>]</span>necklace, a bracelet, an amulet, and a
garter worn on the left leg; whilst on the head was a regular
<i>r&eacute;sille</i> or net, not unlike that of the Spanish national
costume, which net was made of small nerita shells and kept in place by
bone pins.</p>
<p>We must also mention amongst favorite ornaments beads made of jet
and of very fine ochreous clay dried in the sun, of calcareous
crystalline rock, and of grayish schist, and in other places of beads
of amber or of hyaline quartz, the brightness of which attracted the
attention. At the station of Menieux (Charente) with flints of a type
to which it is usual to give the names of Moust&eacute;rien or
Solutr&eacute;en, excavations have yielded numerous carefully polished
balls of calx, varying in diameter from one to two inches. If there had
been any doubts as to their use, those doubts would have been removed
by the discovery at Laugerie-Basse of a fragment of the shoulder-blade
of a reindeer on which was engraved the figure of a woman wearing round
her neck a necklace of clumsy round balls. Other yet stranger ornaments
have been found, for which what we have said about the cannibalism of
early man should have prepared the reader. Our ancestors of the Stone
age adorned themselves with necklaces of human teeth, and two skeletons
have been dug out wearing round their necks this token of their
victories. M. de Baye possesses in his collection some round pieces of
skull pierced with holes (<a href="#fig028">Fig. 28</a>), and at the
meeting of the American Association in 1886, at Ann Arbor (Michigan)
were presented some ornaments made of human bones from a mound in
Ohio.</p>
<p>In taking from the gangue in which it was imbedded a skull from the
megalithic monument of Vaur&eacute;al, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e2901" href="#xd21e2901" name="xd21e2901">110</a>]</span>Pruner
Bey noticed a fragment of a human shoulder blade pierced with an
incision in which was fixed a little rounded piece of bone. This style
of ornament seems to have remained in use for many centuries, for M.
Nicaise has lately discovered at Moulin d&rsquo;Oyes (Marne) a necklace
made of calx balls, shells, and pendants cut out of the scales of unio
shells. On this necklace hung a round piece of human cranium, and in
the Gallic cemetery at Varille, the exterior lamina of a human lumbar
vertebra was fastened to a necklace made of coral beads.</p>

</div>
<p>We are also acquainted with facts of another order, which may be
mentioned in this connection. The men of Marjevols drank out of human
crania; the Grenoble Museum owns a drinking-vessel of this kind; others
have been discovered at Billancourt, at Chavannes, at the Chassey Camp,
and at Sutz, &AElig;fel&eacute;, and Loci-as in Switzerland, as well as
at Brookville in the State of Indiana. Dr. Pruni&egrave;res possesses
half a human radius, probably that of a female, carefully polished and
converted into a stiletto (<a href="#fig029">Fig. 29</a>). Dr. Garrigou
has an arrow-head made of a human bone, Pellegrino a fibula converted
into a polisher found in the lower beds of the celebrated Castione
<i>terremare</i> near Parma. At the meeting of the Prehistoric Congress
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2916" href="#xd21e2916" name=
"xd21e2916">111</a>]</span>in Paris in 1869, Pereira da Costa mentioned
a femora converted into a sceptre or staff of office, and to conclude
this melancholy list, Longp&eacute;rier mentions a human bone pierced
with regular openings, which, by a strange irony of death, served as a
flute to delight the ears of the living.</p>

<p>One of the earliest necessities of human nature must have been
companionship; for help was absolutely necessary to enable man to cope
with the dangers surrounding him. Tribes, formed at first of members of
the same family, must have existed from the very dawn of humanity. The
reindeer phalanges, pierced to serve as whistles (<a href=
"#fig030">Fig. 30</a>), found at <span class="corr" id="xd21e2928"

places, were doubtless used to summon men to war or to the chase. In
the Cottes Cave were found some reindeer and aurochs&rsquo; shanks,
which may naturally be supposed to have served the same purpose. The
curious objects preserved in the Christy collections must also have
been used in war or in the chase. They bear, in addition to the mark of
their owner, notches of different shapes commemorating his exploits in
battle or in hunting. At Solutr&eacute;, MM. Ducrost and Arcelin
noticed fragments of elephants&rsquo; tusks, calcareous plaques, and
some sandstone disks from the Trias, with notches and equidistant lines
evidently having a similar purpose.</p>

<p class="first">Whistle from the Massenat Collection.</p>
</div>
<p>From whistles to regular musical instruments the transition is
simple. Without describing that mentioned by M. de Longp&eacute;rier,
which we cannot confidently assert to be of great antiquity, M. Piette,
in one of his numerous excavations, discovered a primitive flute made
of two bird bones which, when put together and blown into, produced
modulations similar to those of the pipes used by the people of
Oceania; the monotonous music of which is alluded to by Cook. Some time
afterwards M. Piette noticed similar bones in the Rochebertier
collection. So far we know of no other discovery of a similar kind.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2940" href="#xd21e2940" name=

<p>The curious objects known under the name of staves of office would,
if it were needed, afford yet another proof that the men of the Stone
age lived in societies, possessed an organization, and acknowledged a
chief. The staves of office consist of large pieces of reindeer or stag
antler, artistically worked and presenting a pretty uniform appearance.
Their surface is decorated with carvings and engravings representing
animals, plants, and hunting scenes. They are thicker than they are
wide, and the care often taken to reduce the thickness is a proof that
an attempt was made to combine elegance and lightness with solidity
(Figs. <a href="#fig031">31</a>, <a href="#fig032">32</a>, <a href=
"#fig033">33</a>, <a href="#fig034">34</a>, and <a href=
"#fig035">35</a>). Nearly all of them are pierced at one end with large
holes, of which the number varies. Some of these holes were later
additions. May we perhaps see in them the signs of a priesthood, in
which successive ranks were attained, and in which every new
achievement was rewarded with a new distinction? This is difficult to
prove, but these staves could not have been used as weapons or as
tools; the care taken to cover them with ornaments, with the long time
required for this decoration, shows the value their owners attached to
them. The impossibility of any other hypothesis is the best proof we
have of their use.</p>

<p>Amongst the marvellous objects collected by Dr. Schliemann at
Hissarlik, were two fragments of reindeer antler pierced with holes
presenting a singular resemblance to those we have been describing. We
may also compare with them the <i>pogomagan</i>, the badge of office of
Indian chiefs on the Mackenzie River, the Tartar <i>kemous</i>, the
sticks on which the Australians mark by conventional signs any event of
importance to themselves or their tribe, and the similar objects from
Persia, Assam, the Celebes, and New Zealand. But why seek examples so
far away? Is not the memory of these ancient insignia preserved in our
own day, and may they not have been the original forms of the sceptres
of our kings and the croziers of our bishops?</p>

<p>These staves, of which hundreds have now been found, were picked up
in many different places, including the Goyet Cave in Belgium, the
caves of P&eacute;rigord and Charente, and the Veyrier Station in
Savoy. At Thayngen, as many as twenty-three were found, all pierced
with one hole only.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2990src" href=

gone by, one of the most interesting found in 1887 at Montgaudier
(Charente) (<a href="#fig035">Fig. 35</a>), which bears on one side a
representation of two seals, and on the other of two eels, the former
of which especially are executed with a truth to form, boldness of
execution, and delicacy of touch which are positively astonishing when
we remember that the artist (we cannot refuse him this title) bad no
tools at his disposal but a few miserable flints or roughly pointed
bones. The hinder limbs, so strangely placed in amphibia, are
faithfully rendered; each paw has its five toes, the texture of the
skin can be made out, the head is delicately modelled; the muzzle with
its whiskers, the eye, the orifice of the ear, all testify to real
skill. The existence of the seal in the Quaternary epoch in the south
of France was not known until quite recently, when Mr. Hardy found in a
cave near P&eacute;rigueux the remains of a seal (<i lang="la">Phoca
gr&oelig;nlandica</i>), associated with quite an arctic fauna. In part
at least therefore of the Quaternary period, very great cold must have
prevailed in P&eacute;rigord.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3004src" href=
"#xd21e3004" name="xd21e3004src">23</a></p>
<p>With this staff of office were picked up some pieces of ivory
covered with geometrical designs, engraved with some sharp implement,
stilettos, bone needles, knives, flint scrapers, and, stranger still,
the remains of the cave-lion, the cave-hyena, and the <i>Rhinoceros
tichorhinus</i>, all contemporaries of the most ancient Quaternary
fauna.</p>

<p>It was not only on the staves of office that the men of the Stone
age exercised their talent. Many and varied are the subjects which have
been found engraved on plaques of ivory or on stone, and incised on
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3022" href="#xd21e3022" name=
"xd21e3022">117</a>]</span>bears&rsquo; teeth or on stag horn. We
represent one forming the hilt of a dagger (<a href="#fig036">Fig.
36</a>), and another representing a bear with the convex forehead,
characteristic of the species, engraved on a piece of schist (<a href=
"#fig037">Fig. 37</a>), and a mammoth engraved on an ivory plaque with
its long mane, trunk, and curved tusks (<a href="#fig038">Fig. 38</a>).
The artist who depicted these animals with such faithful exactitude
evidently lived amongst them. The first discovery of this kind was made
by Joly-Leterme in the Chaffaud Cave (Vienna); it was a reindeer bone
on which two stags were represented.<a class="noteref" id=

bird&rsquo;s bone bearing on it a drawing of three horses moving
rapidly along. I am obliged to pass over many other most interesting
examples, but I must not omit to mention the magnificent examples which
form part of the Peccadeau collection at Lisle. Cartailhac mentions
some chamois, an ox, and an elephant; some engraved on the bones of
deer and others on fragments of ivory, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p>But for one exception to which I shall refer again, it is curious to
note that we only find these engravings and carvings, which so justly
excite our astonishment in a district of limited extent, bounded on the
north by the Charente, on the south by the Pyrenees and extending on
the east no farther than the department of the Ari&egrave;ge. It is a
pleasant thought that in the midst of their struggle for existence, and
when they had to contend with gigantic pachyderms and formidable beasts
of prey, our most remote ancestors, the contemporaries of the mammoth
and the lion, already developed those artistic tendencies which are the
glory of their descendants.</p>

<p>I referred above to ail exceptional example of prehistoric art found
beyond the borders of France. In excavations in the Thayngen Cave, on
the borders of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3091" href=
"#xd21e3091" name="xd21e3091">121</a>]</span>Switzerland and
Wurtemberg, twenty most remarkable examples were found, in which it is
easy to recognize the horse (<a href="#fig041">Fig. 41</a>), the bear
(<a href="#fig042">Fig. 42</a>), and the reindeer grazing (<a href=
"#fig043">Fig. 43</a>).<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3102src" href=
"#xd21e3102" name="xd21e3102src">25</a> All, especially the last named,
are rendered with such perfection, that it was at first supposed that
they were the work of a forger. A searching inquiry has proved that
they are nothing of the sort; a skilful zo&ouml;logist would have been
needed to represent the <i>Ovibos moschatus</i> (<a href="#fig044">Fig.
44</a>), which retired many centuries ago towards the extreme north. If
we do find a few rare attempts at art in other districts, they are
absolutely rudimentary. The staff of office found in the Goyet Cave is
of very rude workmanship. The Brussels Museum contains a few other
specimens, of which the most important is a fragment of sandstone from
the Frontal Cave, on which a few <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e3112" href="#xd21e3112" name="xd21e3112">122</a>]</span>uncertain
scratches represent what looks like a stag. Some indistinct traces of
engraving have been made out on the bones found in the Altamira Cave,
near Santander, and recently a bone on which a kind of horse was
engraved, was picked up at Cresswell&rsquo;s Crags, Derbyshire, in a
cave known in the district as <i>Mother Grundy&rsquo;s Parlor</i>. This
specimen, as were those of Thayngen, was associated with numerous bones
of Quaternary animals, amongst which those of the hippopotamus were the
most curious.</p>

"images/fig043.jpg" alt="" width="163" height="386">
<p class="first">Reindeer grazing, from the Thayngen Cave.</p>
</div>
<p>The representation of the human figure is extremely rare. I have
already mentioned the young man trying to strike an aurochs which is
running away from him; and the woman wearing a necklace. The former
(<a href="#fig045">Fig. 45</a>), found at Laugerie, is engraved on a
piece of reindeer antler about twenty-five centimetres <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3127" href="#xd21e3127" name=
"xd21e3127">123</a>]</span>long. The aurochs with its head down and
quantities of bristling hair, widely open nostrils, arched and uplifted
tail, presents the appearance of a terrified animal endeavoring to
escape the danger threatening it. The man is naked, and has a round
head, his hair is stiff and seems to stand up on the top of his skull;
on the chin a short beard can clearly be made out; the face expresses
the delight and excitement of the chase. The neck is long, the arm
short, and the spine of unusual length. In the other example of the
representation of the human figure, that of the woman wearing a
necklace, drawn on a piece of a shoulder-blade of a reindeer, she is
seen lying by a stag, and would seem to be in an advanced state of
pregnancy. The piece of bone however is broken, and the head of the
woman is lost, which of course greatly lessens the value of the
relic.</p>

<p>On a fragment of a staff of office from the Madeleine Cave is
engraved a man between two horses&rsquo; heads (<a href="#fig046">Fig.

and very high hips, followed by a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e3147" href="#xd21e3147" name="xd21e3147">124</a>]</span>serpent;
a shell from the crag near Walton-on-the-Naze had a human face roughly
engraved on one side. The Abby, Bourgeois, in the excavations so
fruitful of results at Rochebertier, found a rough carving of a human
face (<a href="#fig047">Fig. 47</a>); M. Piette at Mas d&rsquo;Azil
found a little bust of a woman, carved on the root of the tooth of a
horse. This statuette had a low forehead, a prominent nose, a
retreating chin, and breasts of the negress type of the present day;
characteristics quite unlike those of the skeletons taken from this
cave or those near it. We wonder whether the artist meant to represent
the features of a race other than his own.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3152src" href="#xd21e3152" name="xd21e3152src">26</a> M. du
Bouchet mentions a rough sketch engraved on a flint discovered near
Dax; the workman, doubtless daunted by the difficulties of his task,
had abandoned it unfinished. It is, however, easy to tell what
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3158" href="#xd21e3158" name=
"xd21e3158">125</a>]</span>it was meant for. The skull is low and flat,
the nose but slightly prominent, the eyes are oblique, and neither the
mouth nor the chin are finished. The magnificent collection of the
Marquis de Vibraye contains a little figure from Laugerie, representing
a nude woman without arms. Thin and stiff, she is chiefly remarkable
for the exaggerated size of the sexual organs, and for some peculiar
protuberances on the loins. We dwell upon the former peculiarity,
because it is so far extremely rare, whereas certain relics of the
Greeks and Romans, in spite of the comparatively advanced civilization
of these two great races, are such that they can only be exhibited in
private museums. Such depravity as this implies was then quite an
exception among the cave-men, and but for the one example I have just
mentioned, I have no phallic representations to refer to except the few
from the Massenat collection, which were shown at the Exhibition of
1889.</p>

<p>We must not close this account of the art efforts of the men of the
Stone age without mentioning the remarkable discovery by M. Siette, of
flints covered with lines and geometrical designs colored with red
chalk. These are the very earliest examples of the art of painting
which have hitherto come to our knowledge. They bear witness to a
remarkable progress made by our remote ancestors of the valleys of the
Pyrenees.</p>

<p class="first">The earliest races of men lived in a climate less
rigorous than ours, on the shores of wide rivers, in the midst of
fertile districts, where fishing and the chase easily supplied all
their needs. These races were numerous and prolific, and we find traces
of them all over Western Europe, from Norfolk to the middle of Spain.
What were the homes of these men and their families? Did they crouch in
dens, as Tacitus says the German tribes did in his day? In his
&ldquo;Ancient Wiltshire,&rdquo; Sir R. Coalt Hoare says that the
earliest human habitations were holes dug in the earth and covered over
with the branches of trees. Near Joigny there still remain some
circular holes in the ground, about fifty feet in diameter by sixteen
to twenty deep, known in the country under the name of <i>buvards</i>.
The trunk of a tree was fixed at the bottom and rose above the ground,
and the branches plastered with clay formed the roof. The floor of
these <i>buvards</i> consists of a greasy black earth mixed with bones,
cinders, charcoal, and worked flints. Amongst the last named, polished
hatchets predominate, which proves that these refuges were inhabited in
Neolithic times, but there is nothing to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e3207" href="#xd21e3207" name="xd21e3207">128</a>]</span>prevent
our supposing that they were also occupied in the Pal&aelig;olithic
period. Ameghino gives a still more striking example of an
earth-dwelling. Near Mercedes, about twenty leagues from Buenos Ayres,
he picked up numerous human bones, together with arrow-heads, chisels,
flint knives, bone stilettos and polishers, and bones of animals
scratched and cut by man. Later, Ameghino discovered the actual
dwelling of this primeval man, and his strange home was beneath the
carapace of a gigantic armadillo, the now extinct glyptodon seen in
<a href="#fig048">Fig. 48.</a></p>
<div class="figure xd21e3213width" id="fig048"><img src=
"images/fig048.jpg" alt="" width="237" height="117">
<p class="first">The glyptodon.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;All around the carapace,&rdquo; says Ameghino, &ldquo;in the
reddish agglomerate of the original soil lay charcoal cinders, burnt
and split bones, and flints. Digging beneath this, a flint implement
was found, with some long split llama and stag bones, which had
evidently been handled by man, with some toxodon and mylodon
teeth.&rdquo; <a href="#fig049">Fig. 49</a> represents the now extinct
mylodon. Some time afterwards, the discovery of another carapace under
similar conditions added weight to Ameghino&rsquo;s
supposition.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3222src" href="#xd21e3222"

accident of conformation affords shelter from heat or cold or a
hiding-place from wild beasts, man was not at a loss; he hollowed out
for himself a hole in the earth, roofing it over with the shell of a
glyptodon, and securing a retreat where he could be safe at least for a
time.</p>

<p>It was not until later, driven to do so by the cold, that man learnt
to use the natural caves hollowed out in limestone rocks, either in
geological convulsions or by the quieter action of water. The absence
in the caves which have been excavated in America of implements of the
Chell&eacute;en type, the most ancient known as yet, would point to
this conclusion, though it is impossible to fix the earliest date of
their occupation. This date, moreover, varies very much in different
localities. The earth was but gradually peopled, and our ancestors
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3234" href="#xd21e3234" name=
"xd21e3234">130</a>]</span>penetrated into different countries in
successive migrations. Some caves have recently been discovered in
Wales, in the midst of Glacial deposits.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3236src" href="#xd21e3236" name="xd21e3236src">2</a> The Boulder
Clay and marine drift on neighboring heights are incontrovertible
proofs of the submergence of this region, when Great Britain was almost
completely covered with ice. Excavations made in 1886 have brought to
light a series of deposits, one above the other, the gravel and red
earth containing Quaternary bones and worked flints, whilst the
stalagmite and ooze are evidently of more recent origin. This is the
usual state of things in all the English eaves; but in those of the
Clyde, the bone beds had been disturbed and mixed with striated pebbles
and Glacial drift. From this Hicks, who superintended the excavations,
concluded that man and the Quaternary animals had lived in those caves
before the Glacial epoch, and before the great submergence, which in
some places was no less than some 1,300 feet below the present level of
the sea. If this were so, it would be one of the most ancient proofs
not only of the presence of man, but also of the kind of habitation he
first dwelt in. These conclusions have, however, been hotly disputed.
M. Arcelin<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3245src" href="#xd21e3245" name=
"xd21e3245src">3</a> remarks that there are in England two exceptional
geological landmarks, the Forest Bed representing the last Pliocene
formations, and the River Gravels, which are the most ancient
Quaternary deposits. Between the two, we find the Boulder Clay of
Glacial origin. Now the fauna of the caves of the Clyde, far from
resembling that of the Forest <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3250"
href="#xd21e3250" name="xd21e3250">131</a>]</span>Bed, appears to be
more recent than that of the ancient deposits of the River Gravels.
Amongst this fauna we find neither the <i>Elephas antiquus</i> nor the
<i>Rhinoceros Merckii</i>; the worked flints are not like those known
as belonging to the River-Gravel type, but the relics more nearly
resemble those of the Reindeer period of France. It is therefore
impossible, in the present state of our knowledge, to assert that man
lived in the southwest of England in the Glacial epoch, to the
phenomena of which, if he witnessed them, he must eventually have
fallen a victim.</p>
<p>Our ancestors must constantly have disputed the possession of their
caves of refuge with animals, but there is often a certain distinction
between those chiefly occupied by man and the mere dens of wild beasts.
The latter are generally more difficult of access, and are only to be
entered by long, low, narrow, dark passages. Those permanently
inhabited by man are wide, not very deep, and they are well lighted.
That at Montgaudier, for instance, has an arched entrance some
forty-five feet wide by eighteen high. The cave-men had already learnt
to appreciate the advantages of air and light.</p>
<p>The caves are often of considerable height; that of Massat is some
560 feet high, that of Lherm is 655, that of Bouicheta nearly 755, that
of Loubens 820, and that of Santhenay is, as much as 1,344 feet high.
Those of Eyzi&egrave;s, Moustier, and Aurignac are also very lofty. As
the valleys were hollowed out by the rushing torrents of the Quaternary
floods, men sought a home near the waters which were indispensable to
their existence, and came to dwell on the shores of rivers. The most
ancient of the inhabited caves, therefore, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3263" href="#xd21e3263" name=
"xd21e3263">132</a>]</span>are those on the highest levels, but the
difference in the nature of the country and the varying force of
geological action have led to so many exceptions, that all we can say
with any certainty is that the caves were inhabited at different
epochs. That of Montgaudier, for instance, was filled with an
accumulation of ooze about forty feet thick. Weapons and tools lay one
above the other from the bottom to the top, and it is easy to
distinguish the succession of hearths by the blackened earth, cinders,
charcoal, and crushed bones lying about them.</p>
<p>In the Placard Cave eight different deposits bear witness to the
presence of man; and these are separated by others bare of traces of
human occupation. The lowest deposit, which is some twenty-five feet
below the present level of the soil, contains worked flints of the
Moust&eacute;rien type, above which, but separated by an accumulation
of <i>d&eacute;bris</i> which has fallen from the roof, comes a layer
in which was found a number of arrow-heads of the shape of laurel
leaves. The fauna of both these levels includes the reindeer, the
horse, and the aurochs. As we go up we find, above another layer of
<i>d&eacute;bris</i>, the Solutr&eacute;en type of tools and weapons
represented by bone implements and numerous arrow-heads, this time
stalked and notched. The four following levels correspond with those
belonging to what is known as the Madeleine type, and the arrow-heads
are decorated with geometrical designs. The traces of human occupation
at different times, doubtless separated by long intervals, are
therefore very clearly defined. The Fontabert Cave, in Dauphin&eacute;,
contained, at a depth of about six feet, traces of fire and roughly
worked flints, and about three feet below the surface <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3273" href="#xd21e3273" name=
"xd21e3273">133</a>]</span>lay the skeleton of a man, who had perhaps
been overtaken by a fall of earth, still holding in his hand a polished
dipper of fine workmanship. Yet a third and evidently more recent
period is characterized by a jade crescent. We might easily multiply
instances of a similar kind, but that we wish to avoid so much
repetition.</p>
<p>We soon begin to find evidence of the progress made by man, and
though in Neolithic times he still continued to occupy caves he learned
to adapt them better to his needs. The rock shelters of the Petit-Morin
valley, so well explored by M. de Baye, are the best examples we can
give.</p>
<p>These caves are hollowed out of a very thick belt of cretaceous
limestone. They date from different epochs, and each presents special
characteristics which can easily be recognized. Some were used as
burial-places, others as habitations. In the former the entrance is of
irregular shape, the walls are roughly cut, and the work is of the most
elementary description. The sepulchral eaves were simply closed by a
large stone rolled into place and covered with rubbish, the better to
hide the entrance. The shelters used to live in show much more careful
work, and are divided into two unequal parts by a wall cut in the
living rock. To get into the second partition one has to go down steps,
cut in the limestone, and these steps are worn with long usage. The
entrance was cut out of a massive piece of rock, left thick on purpose,
and on either side of the opening the edges still show the rabbet which
was to receive the door. Two small holes on the right and left were
probably used to fix a bar across the front to strengthen the entrance.
A good many of these eaves are provided with an opening for
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3280" href="#xd21e3280" name=
"xd21e3280">134</a>]</span>ventilation, and some skilful contrivances
were resorted to for keeping out water. Inside we find different
floors, shelves, and crockets cut in the chalk, and on the floors M. de
Baye picked up shells, ornaments, and flints, which were lying just
where their owners had left them. Very different is all this from the
Vez&egrave;re caves, and everything proves an undeniable improvement in
the conditions of life.</p>
<p>The most interesting of all the objects found in these caves are,
however, the carvings; but few date from Neolithic times, and some
arch&aelig;ologists have argued from their absence in favor of the
displacement everywhere of old races by the incursion of new-corners.
Some of these carvings represent hafted hatchets, the flint being
painted black to make the raised design stand out better. Others
represent human figures. In the Coizard Cave, for instance, was found a
roughly outlined representation of a woman with a prominent nose, eyes
indicated by black dots, highly developed breasts, but no lower limbs.
A necklace adorns her throat, and a pendant hanging from this necklace
is colored yellow. On the passage leading to the door is engraved
another figure which was originally more accurately drawn than the
others, but is not in such good preservation. In the Courjonnet Cave we
see a woman with a bird&rsquo;s bead; she was probably one of the
<i>lares penates</i>, the protectors of the domestic hearth. We meet
with this same goddess at Santorin, and at Troy, and on the shores of
the Vistula, which is a very interesting ethnological fact.</p>
<p>The objects found in the sepulchral caves are important, and
included a number of arrow-heads with transverse cutting edges. There
is no doubt about <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3289" href=
"#xd21e3289" name="xd21e3289">135</a>]</span>their use; they have been
picked up in black earth, in contact with human bones, the
decomposition of the soft parts of which caused them to fall out of the
mortal wound they had inflicted. With these arrow-heads were found
flint knives, large sloped scrapers, polishers, and bone stilettos, the
femora of a ruminant with a pig&rsquo;s tooth fixed on to each end,
hoes made of stag horn, beads and pendants made of bone, shell, schist,
quartz, and aragonite, with the teeth of bears, boars, wolves, and
foxes, all pierced with holes. Some of the shell anti schist beads were
spread upon the surface of the skull, and perhaps formed a net or
<i>r&eacute;sille</i>, such as that already referred to as found at
Baouss&eacute;-Rouss&eacute;.</p>
<p>For centuries this occupation of caves continued, offering as they
did a shelter that was dry and warm in winter, and cool in summer.
Homer tells us that the Cyclops lived on the heights of the mountains
and in the depths of the caves,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3296src"
href="#xd21e3296" name="xd21e3296src">4</a> and Prometheus says that,
like the feeble ant, men dwelt in deep subterranean caves, where the
sun never penetrated.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3299src" href=
"#xd21e3299" name="xd21e3299src">5</a></p>
<p>Whilst the men of the Petit-Morin valley hollowed out caves, or
enlarged those made by nature, others took refuge in huts made of dried
clay and interlaced branches, or in tents of the skins of the animals
they had slain, and, though these fragile dwellings have disappeared,
leaving no trace, there yet remain indelible evidences of the presence
of many successive generations. Everywhere throughout the world we find
heaps of rubbish, consisting chiefly of the shells of mollusca and
crustacea, broken bones, flakes of flint, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e3304" href="#xd21e3304" name="xd21e3304">136</a>]</span>and
fragments of stone and bone implements, covering vast areas and often
rising to a considerable height.</p>
<p>Not until our own day did these rubbish heaps attract attention, and
it was reserved to our own generation, so interested in all that
relates to the past, to recognize their true significance. Steenstrup
noticed, in the north of Europe, that these mounds consisted nearly
entirely of the shells of edible species, such as the oyster, mussel,
and <i>littorina littorea</i>; that they were all those of adult
specimens, but not all subject to similar conditions of existence or
native to the same waters. The kitchen-middings, or heaps of kitchen
refuse&mdash;such was the name given to these shell-mounds&mdash;could
not have been the natural deposits left by the waves after storms, for
in that case they would have been mixed with quantities of sand and
pebbles. The conclusion is inevitable, that man alone could have piled
up these accumulations, which were the refuse flung away day by day
after his meals. The excavation of the kitchen-middings confirmed in a
remarkable manner the opinion of Steenstrup, and everywhere a number of
important objects were discovered. In several places the old hearths
were brought to light. They consisted of flat stones, on which were
piles of cinders, with fragments of wood and charcoal. It was now
finally proved that these mounds occupied the site of ancient
settlements, the inhabitants of which rarely left the coast, and fed
chiefly on the mollusca which abounded in the waters of the North
Sea.</p>
<p>These primeval races, however savage they may have been, were not
wanting in intelligence. The earliest inhabitants of Russia placed
their dwellings near rivers above the highest flood-level known to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3313" href="#xd21e3313" name=
"xd21e3313">137</a>]</span>or foreseen by them. The Scandinavians were
most precise in the orientation of their homes, and M. de Quatrefages
points out that the kitchen-midding of S&oelig;lager is set against a
hill in the best position for protecting those who lived near it from
the north winds, which are so trying in these districts on account of
their violence. At Havelse, says Sir John Lubbock, the settlement was
on rather higher ground, and, though close to the shore, was quite
beyond the reach of the waves. The English visitors had an excavation
made whilst they were present, and in two or three hours they obtained
about a hundred fragments of bone, many rude flakes, sling stones, and
fragments of flint, together with some rough axes of the ordinary
shell-mound type. The excavations at Meilgaard a little later by the
same explorers were even more fruitful in results.</p>
<p>Scandinavia does not appear to have been occupied in the Paleolithic
period, and the most ancient facts concerning it only date from the
expeditions of the Romans against the Teutons, and our knowledge even
of them is very incomplete.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3317src" href=
"#xd21e3317" name="xd21e3317src">6</a> We are still ignorant of much
which may have been known to the Carthaginians and the
Ph&oelig;nicians. It is possible that in the remote days under notice
the Scandinavians were ignorant of the art of tilling the ground, for
so far no cereal or agricultural product of any kind has been
discovered, nor the bones of any domestic animal, except indeed those
of the dog, which may, however, have been still in a wild state.
Amongst the bones collected from the kitchen-middings, those of the
stag, the kid, and the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3323" href=
"#xd21e3323" name="xd21e3323">138</a>]</span>boar are much the most
numerous. The bear, the urns, the wild cat, the otter, the porpoise,
the seal, and the small mammals, the marten, the water-rat and the
mouse, have also been found. At Havelse were collected more than 3,500
mammal bones, amongst which do not occur those of the musk-ox, the
reindeer, the elk, or the marmot; their absence bearing witness to a
more temperate climate than that of the present day in the regions
under notice. The stag antlers found belong to every season of the
year, from which we may conclude that the people of these districts,
like the cave-men of the Pyrenees, had given up a nomad life and
remained at home all the year round, living in the dwellings they had
built upon the shores of the sea.</p>
<p>Amongst the birds found, we may mention the large penguin, now
extinct, the moor-fowl, which fed entirely on pine buds, and several
species of clucks and geese; whilst amongst the fish were the herring,
the cod, the dab, and the eel. The numerous relics of chelonia prove
the existence of numbers of the turtle tribe in the North Sea.</p>
<p>A great variety of objects, most of them of a coarse type, have been
found beneath the kitchen-middings; metals are however completely
absent, and it is probable that they were quite unknown to the
Scandinavians for several centuries after their arrival in the
country.</p>
<p>It is easy to quote similar facts in other countries. In 1877, Count
Ouvarof mentioned, at the Arch&aelig;ological Congress at Kazan, some
kitchen-middings near the Oka, a little river flowing into the Volga
near Nijni-Novgorod. In excavating some <i>bougrys</i>, or little
mounds of sand overlooking the valley, he discovered <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3334" href="#xd21e3334" name=
"xd21e3334">139</a>]</span>amongst the layers of alluvium, successive
deposits of cinders and fragments of charcoal, which appear to have
been the remains of a fire. A little lower down in another deposit were
fragments of pottery, stone weapons and implements, and an immense
number of shells. Judging from these relics of their daily life, this
numerous population must have fed exclusively on fish and mollusca, for
excavations brought to light but few mammal bones. The mollusca were
all of species that only live in salt water. From this we know that the
waves washed the shores near this <i>bougry</i>, and that a milder
climate probably prevailed in these regions, making life more
supportable.</p>
<p>Virchow has recognized on the shores of Lake Burtneek in Germany, a
kitchen-midding belonging to the earliest Neolithic times, perhaps even
to the close of the Pal&aelig;olithic period. He there picked up some
stone and bone implements, and notices on the one hand the absence of
the reindeer, and on the other, as in Scandinavia, that of domestic
animals. But in this case, the home of the living became the tomb of
the dead, and numerous skeletons lay beside the abandoned hearths.
Similar discoveries have been made in Portugal; shell-heaps having been
found thirty-five to forty miles from the coast, and from sixty-five to
eighty feet above the sea-level. Here also excavations have brought to
light several different hearths; and in many of the most ancient
kitchen-middings in the valley of the Tigris were found crouching
skeletons, proving that here too the home had become the tomb.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3342src" href="#xd21e3342" name=
"xd21e3342src">7</a></p>
<p>Similar deposits are by no means rare in France. M. du Chatellier
mentions one in Brittany, which he <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e3347" href="#xd21e3347" name="xd21e3347">140</a>]</span>estimates
as 325 cubic feet in size. From it be has taken spear- and arrow-heads,
knives and scrapers, some highly finished, others but roughly cut and
often with scarcely any shape at all. The population was evidently
ichthyophagous, to judge by the vast accumulations of shells of
scallops, oysters, limpets, pectens, and other mollusca. The few animal
bones are those of the stag, the bear, and certain wading birds.</p>
<p>At Canche, near &Eacute;taples, has been evade out a series of
mounds forming a semicircle some eight hundred and fifty feet in
extent. These mounds are made up of successive layers of shells and
charcoal, the relics of successive occupations. Lastly we must mention
a kitchen-midding situated at the mouth of the Somme, which is eight
hundred and twenty feet long by about one hundred wide. It consists
principally of shells of adult species, with which are mixed fragments
of coarse black pottery and numerous goat and sheep bones, the latter
bearing witness to a more recent date than that of the kitchen-middings
of Scandinavia or of Germany.</p>
<p>Throughout Europe similar facts are coming to light. Evans mentions
heaps of shells on the coasts of England. Chantre speaks of others near
Lake Gotchai in the Caucasus, and Nordenski&ouml;ld of others at Cape
North, to which he wishes to restore its true name of Jokaipi. He sass
these mounds are exactly like those of Denmark.</p>
<p>It is, however, chiefly in America that these heaps attract
attention, for there huge shell-mounds stretch along the coast in
Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Massachusetts, Louisiana, California, and
Nicaragua. We meet with them again near the Orinoco and the
Mississippi, in the Aleutian Islands, and in the Guianas, in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3355" href="#xd21e3355" name=
"xd21e3355">141</a>]</span>Brazil and in Patagonia, on the coasts of
the Pacific as on those of the Atlantic. Owing to the darker color of
the vegetation growing on them, the shell-heaps of Tierra del Fuego are
seen from afar by the navigator. For a long time the true character of
these mounds was not known, and they were attributed to natural causes,
such as the emergence of the ancient coast-line from the sea, and it
was not until lately that it was discovered that they were the work of
men.</p>
<p>Some of these kitchen-middings are of great size. Sir Charles Lyell
describes one on St. Simon&rsquo;s Island, at the mouth of the Altamaha
(Georgia), which covers ten acres of ground and varies in height from
five to ten feet. It consisted almost entirely of oyster shells. In
America, as in Europe, excavations brought to light hatchets, flints,
arrows, and fragments of pottery. Another of these mounds, near the St.
John River, consists, as does that visited by Lyell, of oyster shells,
and is of extraordinary dimensions, being three hundred feet long, and
though the exact width cannot be made out, is certainly several hundred
feet across. Putnam<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3359src" href=
"#xd21e3359" name="xd21e3359src">8</a> gives an account of the
excavation of one of these mounds formed of shells of the <i>Mya,
Venus, Pecten, Buccinum</i>, and <i>Natica</i> genera. It stretched
along the sea-coast for a distance of several hundred feet, it was from
four to five feet thick, and penetrated some distance below the surface
of the ground. The valves had been opened with the aid of heat, and the
animal bones found with the shells had been broken with heavy hammers
which were found in the kitchen-midding. The bones included those of
the stag, the wolf, and the fox. Fishes were also represented by
remains of the cod, the plaice, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e3370" href="#xd21e3370" name="xd21e3370">142</a>]</span>and
chelonia by turtle shells. Some bird bones were also found, and the
knives, arrow- and spear-heads, scrapers, etc., were all of the rudest
workmanship. Mr. Phelps has superintended yet more important
excavations at Damariscotta<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3372src" href=
"#xd21e3372" name="xd21e3372src">9</a> and all along the coast to the
month of the Penobscot. In the lowest layers he made out ancient
hearths, and found numerous fragments of pottery which are the most
ancient examples of keramic ware found in New England, and were covered
with incised ornamentation of considerable refinement.</p>
<p>The kitchen-middings of Florida and Alabama are even more
remarkable. There is one on Amelia Island which is a quarter of a mile
long with a medium depth of three feet and a breadth of nearly five.
That of Bear&rsquo;s Point covers sixty acres of ground, that of
Anercerty Point one hundred, and that of Santa Rosa five hundred.
Others taper to a great height. Turtle Mound, near Smyrna, is formed of
a mass of oyster shells attaining a height of nearly thirty feet, and
the height of several others is more than forty feet.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e3379src" href="#xd21e3379" name="xd21e3379src">10</a> In all
of them bushels of shells have already been found, although a great
part of the sites they occupy are still unexplored; huge trees, roots,
and tropical creepers having, in the course of many centuries, covered
them with an almost impenetrable thicket.</p>
<p>Whether man did or did not live in the basin of the Delaware at the
most remote times of which we have any knowledge, we meet with traces
of his occupation in the same latitude at more recent periods. At
Long-Nick-Branch is a shell-mound that extends for half a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3384" href="#xd21e3384" name=
"xd21e3384">143</a>]</span>mile, and in California there is a yet
larger kitchen-midding. It measures a mile in length by half a mile in
width, and, as in similar accumulations, excavations have yielded
thousands of stone hammers and bone implements (<a href="#fig024">Fig.
24</a>).</p>
<p>The shell-mounds of which we have so far been speaking are all near
the sea, but there is yet another consisting entirely of marine shells
fifty miles beyond Mobile. This fact seems to point to a considerable
change in the level of the ground since the time of man&rsquo;s first
occupancy, for he is not likely to have taken all the trouble involved
in carrying the mollusca necessary for his daily food so far, when he
might so easily have settled down near the shore.</p>
<p>I cannot close this account of the kitchen-middings, without calling
attention to two very interesting facts. The importance of these mounds
bears witness alike to the number of the inhabitants who dwelt near
them, and the long duration of their sojourn. Worsaae sets back the
initial date of the most ancient of the shell-mounds of the New World
more than three thousand years. This is however a delicate question, on
which in the present state of our knowledge it is difficult to hazard a
serious opinion. It is easier to come to a conclusion on other points:
the close resemblance, for instance, between the kitchen-middings of
America and those of Europe. In both continents we find the early
inhabitants fed almost entirely on fish; their weapons, tools, and
pottery were almost identical in character; and in both cases the
characteristic animals of Quaternary times had disappeared, and the use
of metals still remained unknown. Are these remarkable coincidences the
result of chance, or must we not rather <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e3393" href="#xd21e3393" name="xd21e3393">144</a>]</span>suppose
that people of the same origin occupied at the same epoch both sides of
the Atlantic?</p>
<p>The man of the kitchen-middings evidently had a fixed abode. Long
since, the tent, the temporary shelter of the nomad, had given place to
the but. We have already said what this but may have been like, but the
most certain data we have as to human habitations at this still but
little known epoch, are those supplied by the Lake Stations of
Switzerland, and it is to our own generation that we are indebted for
the first discoveries relating to them.</p>
<p>The memory of these Lake Stations bad completely passed away, and it
was only the long drought which desolated Switzerland in 1853 and 1854,
and the extraordinary sinking of Lake Zurich, revealing the piles still
standing, that attracted the attention of arch&aelig;ologists. In the
space still enclosed by these piles lay scattered pell-mell stones,
bones, burnt cinders of ancient hearths, pestles, hammers, pottery,
hatchets of various shapes, implements of many kinds, with innumerable
objects of daily use. These relics prove that some of the ancient
inhabitants of Switzerland had dwelt on the lake where they were found,
in a refuge to which they had probably retired to escape from the
attacks of their fellow-men or wild beasts. Though they bad succeeded
in getting away from these enemies, they were to fall victims to a yet
more formidable adversary, and the half-burnt piles have preserved to
our own day the traces of a conflagration that destroyed the Lake
dwelling so laboriously constructed.</p>
<p>The discovery of these piles excited general interest, an interest
that was redoubled when similar discoveries revealed that all the lakes
of Switzerland were dotted <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3402"
href="#xd21e3402" name="xd21e3402">145</a>]</span>with stations that
had been built long centuries before in the midst of the waters. Twenty
such stations were made out on Lake Bienne, twenty-four on the Lake of
Geneva, thirty on Lake Constance, forty-nine on that of
Neuch&acirc;tel, and others, though not so many, on Lakes Sempach,
Morat, Mooseedorf, and Pfeffikon. In fact more than two hundred Lake
Stations are now known in Switzerland; and how many more may have
completely disappeared?</p>
<p>There is really nothing to surprise us in the fact of buildings
rising from the midst of waters. They are known in historic times;
Herodotus relates that the inhabitants of pile dwellings on Lake
Prasias successfully repelled the attacks of the Persians commanded by
Megabasus. Alonzo de Ojeda, the companion of Amerigo Vespucci, speaks
of a village consisting of twenty large houses built on piles in the
midst of a lake, to which he gave the name of Venezuela in honor of
Venice, his native town. We meet with pile dwellings in our own day in
the Celebes, in New Guinea, in Java, at Mindanao, and in the Caroline
Islands. Sir Richard Burton saw pile dwellings at Dahomey, Captain
Cameron on the lakes of Central Africa, and the Bishop of Labuan tells
us that the houses of the Dayaks are built on lofty platforms on the
shores of rivers. The accounts of historians and travellers help us to
understand alike the anode of construction of the Lake Stations and the
kind of life led by their inhabitants.</p>
<p>The Lake dwellings of Switzerland may be assigned to three different
periods. That of Chavannes, on Lake Bienne, belongs to the earliest
type. The hatchets found are small, scarcely polished, and always of
native <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3408" href="#xd21e3408" name=
"xd21e3408">146</a>]</span>rock, such as serpentine, diorite, or
saussurite; the pottery is coarse, mixed with grains of sand or bits of
quartz; the bottoms of the vases are thick, and no traces of
ornamentation can be made out. The pile-dwellings of the second period,
such as those of Locras and Latringen, show considerable progress; the
hatchets, some of which are very large, are well made. Several of them
are of nephrite, chloromelanite, and jade; and their number, as
compared with those in minerals native to Switzerland, varies from five
to eight per cent. Here and there in rare instances we find a few
copper or bronze lamellae amongst the piles. The pottery is now of
finer clay, better kneaded; and ornamentation, including chevrons,
wolves&rsquo; teeth, and mammillated designs, is more common. The
handle, however, is still a mere projection. The third period, which we
may date from the transition from stone to bronze, is largely
represented; copper weapons and tools are already numerous, and bronze
is beginning to occur. The stone hatchets and hammers are skilfully
pierced, and wooden or horn implements are often found. The vases are
of various shapes, all provided with handles, and are covered with
ornaments, some made with the fingers of the potter, others with the
help of a twig or some fine string. On the other hand, there are no
hatchets of foreign rock; commerce and intercourse with people at a
distance had ceased, or at least become rarer. The tools are fixed into
handles of stag horn, which are found in every stage of manufacture.
The personal property of the Lake Dwellers included bead necklaces,
pendants, buttons, needles, and horn combs. The teeth of animals served
as amulets, and the bones that were of denser material <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3410" href="#xd21e3410" name=
"xd21e3410">147</a>]</span>than born were used as javelin- or
arrow-heads. The arrows were generally of triangular shape and not
barbed.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3412src" href="#xd21e3412" name=
"xd21e3412src">11</a></p>
<p>The distance from the shore of the most ancient of the Lake
dwellings varies from 131 to 298 feet. Gradually men began to take
greater and greater precautions against danger, and the most recent
stations are 656 to 984 feet from the banks of the lake. The piles of
the Stone age are from eleven to twelve inches in diameter; those of
the later epochs are smaller. They are pointed at the ends, and
hardened by fire. When the piles had been driven into the bottom of the
lake, a platform was laid on them solid enough to bear the weight of
the huts. This platform was made of beams laid down horizontally, and
bound together by interlaced branches. Two modes of construction can
easily be distinguished. In one the platforms were upheld by numerous
piles, ten yards long, firmly driven into the mud. This is how the
<i>Pfahlbauten, Palafittes</i>, or pile dwellings situated in shallow
waters were generally put together. In other cases it seemed easier to
raise the soil round the piles, than to drive them into the hard rock
which formed the bed of the lake. Care was then taken to consolidate
them, and keep them in position with blocks of stone, clay, and tiers
of piles. Keller gives to these latter the name of
<i>Packwerbauten</i>, and other German arch&aelig;ologists call them
<i>Steinbergen</i>.</p>
<p>The mean depth of the waters in those parts of the lakes formerly
occupied by the pile dwellings is from thirteen to sixteen feet, and we
can still make out the piles when the water is calm and clear. Worn
though <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3428" href="#xd21e3428" name=
"xd21e3428">148</a>]</span>they may be, their tops still emerge at a
height varying from one to three feet above the mud at the bottom of
the lake. Their number was originally considerable, and it is estimated
that there were forty thousand at Wangen, and a hundred thousand at
Robenhausen. The area occupied by the stations varies considerably;
according to Troyon, that at Wangen was seven hundred paces long by one
hundred and twenty broad. Baron von Mayenfisch explored seventeen sites
in the Lake of Constance, the area of which varies from three to four
acres. At Inkwyl is a little artificial island about forty-eight feet
in diameter. The Lake dwelling of Morges, which was still inhabited in
the Bronze age, covers an area of twelve hundred feet long by a mean
width of one hundred and fifty. It is, however, useless to enumerate
the various calculations that have been made, as they are founded on
nothing but more or less probable guesswork.</p>
<p>Excavations show that the huts that rose from the platforms were
made of wattle and hurdle-work. In different places calcined and
agglutinated fragments have been picked up, and pieces of clay which
had served as facing. The house to which they had belonged had been
destroyed by fire, and the clay, hardened in the flames, had resisted
the disintegrating action of the water. On one side this clay is
smooth, and on the other it still retains the marks of the interlaced
branches, which had helped to form the inner walls. Some of these marks
are so clear and regular that Troyon, noticing the way they curve, was
able to assert that the huts were circular, and that they varied in
diameter from ten to fifteen feet.</p>
<p>A recent discovery at Schussenreid (Wurtemberg) gives completeness
to our knowledge of the Swiss <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3434"
href="#xd21e3434" name="xd21e3434">149</a>]</span>Lake dwellings. In
the midst of a peat-bog rises a but known as a <i>Kn&uuml;ppelbau</i>,
which is supposed to date from the Stone age. It is of rectangular
form, and is divided into two compartments communicating with each
other by a foot-bridge consisting of three beams laid side by side. The
floors of this but are made of rounded wood, and the walls of piles
split in half. Excavations have brought to light several floors, one
above the other, and divided by thick layers of clay. The rising of the
level of the peat doubtless compelled the Lake Dweller to add by
degrees to the height of his house.</p>
<p>The Proto-Helvetian race were well-developed men, and the bones that
have been collected show that they were not at all wanting in symmetry
of form or in cranial capacity. The crania found are distinctly
dolichocephalous, and their owners had evidently attained to no small
degree of culture and of technical skill. Judging from the length of
the femora found, though it must be added that they are mostly those of
women, the ancient Lake Dwellers were not so tall as the present
inhabitants of Europe. The smallness of the handles of their weapons
and tools points to the same conclusion.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3441src" href="#xd21e3441" name="xd21e3441src">12</a></p>
<p>Though the importance and number of the discoveries made in
Switzerland render it the classic land of Lake Stations, it is not the
only country in which they have been found. They have been made out in
the Lago Maggiore and in the lakes of Var&egrave;se, Peschiera, and
Garda in Lombardy; in Lake Salpi in the Capitanata, and in other parts
of Italy. Judging from the objects recovered from these stations, they
belonged partly to the Stone and partly to the Bronze age. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3446" href="#xd21e3446" name=
"xd21e3446">150</a>]</span></p>
<p>The pile dwelling of Lagozza is one of the most interesting known to
us. It forms a long square, facing due east, and covers an area of two
thousand six hundred yards, now completely overgrown with peat six and
a half feet thick. Amongst the posts still standing can be made out a
number of half-burnt planks, which are probably the remains of the
platform. One of the posts was still covered with bark, and it was easy
to recognize the silver birch (<i>Betula alba</i>). Other posts
consisted of the trunks of resinous trees, such as the <i>Pinus
picea</i>, the <i>Pinus sylvestris</i>, and the larch, which now only
grow in the lofty Alpine valleys. Amongst the industrial objects found
in the Lagozza pile dwelling were polished stone hatchets, hammers,
polishers of hard stone, knife-blades, flint scrapers, and seven or
eight arrows with transverse cutting edges, a form rare in Italy.</p>
<p>Castelfranco,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3461src" href="#xd21e3461"
name="xd21e3461src">13</a> from whom we borrow these details, has also,
in the excavations he superintended, picked up a number of earthenware
spindle-whorls with a hole in the middle, amulets, and numerous pieces
of pottery, some fine and some coarse, according to the purpose for
which they were intended. The first mould had in most cases been
covered over with a layer of very fine clay spread upon it with the aid
of a kind of boasting-chisel. We may also mention a bone comb. The
combs found in Swiss Lake dwellings are of horn, with the exception of
one from Locras of yew wood.</p>
<p>What chiefly distinguishes the Lagozza pile dwelling, however, is
the absence of the bones, teeth, or horns of animals, and also of
fish-hooks, harpoons, or nets, so that we must conclude that the
inhabitants did not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3468" href=
"#xd21e3468" name="xd21e3468">151</a>]</span>hunt or fish, that they
did not breed domestic animals, and were probably vegetarians. The
researches of Professor Sordelli confirm this hypothesis; from amongst
the objects taken from the peat he recognized two kinds of corn
(<i>Triticum vulgare antiquorum</i> and <i>Triticum vulagere
hibernum</i>), six-rowed barley (<i>Hordeum hexastichum</i>), mosses,
ferns, flax, the Indian poppy (<i>Papaver somniferum</i>), acorns, and
an immense number of nuts and apples.</p>
<p>The acorns are those of the common oak, and their cups and outer
rind had been removed, so that they had evidently been prepared to
serve as food for, man; the apples were small and coriaceous,
resembling the modern crab-apple; the Indian poppy cannot have grown
without cultivation; but this was perhaps but an example of the same
species already recognized in the Lake dwellings of Switzerland. It is
difficult to say whether it was used for food or whether oil was
extracted from it.</p>
<p>We have already spoken of the discoveries made in Austria and
Hungary. Count Wurmbrand has described the difficulties with which
explorers had to contend. The lakes have in many cases become
inaccessible swamps, and in others, the waters having been artificially
dimmed to regulate their overflow, the sites of the pile dwellings are
so far below the level of the lakes that any excavations are
impossible. Long and arduous researches have, however, been rewarded
with some success, and the numerous objects recovered bear witness, as
in Switzerland, to the gradual progress made by the successive
generations who occupied these pile dwellings.</p>

eight to ten inches in diameter, were placed at regular intervals. The

"xd21e3504" href="#xd21e3504" name="xd21e3504">153</a>]</span>hundreds
of needles of different sizes, stilettos, dagger-blades, arrows, and
hatchets, with stag-horn handles. Coarse black earthenware vases are
equally numerous and are of a great variety of form, but their
ornamentation is of the most primitive description, and was done
sometimes with the nail of the potter, and sometimes with a pointed
bone. Little earthenware figures (Figs. <a href="#fig051">51</a> and
<a href="#fig052">52</a>) were also found, some of which were sent from
the Laybach Museum to the French Exhibition of 1878. One of them is
said to represent a woman, probably an idol. This is one of the first
known examples of the representation of the human figure from a Lake
dwelling. At Nimlau, near Olmutz, the drying lip of a little lake
brought to light a Lake Station surrounded by the trunks of oak trees
of a large size. They were piled up, one above the other, and strongly
bound together with osiers. These trunks were evidently intended to
fortify the station.</p>

<p>The mode of construction of the Lake Stations of the marshes of
Pomerania is very different from that employed in Switzerland or in
Austria. The foundations rest on horizontal beams, kept in place either
by great blocks of rock or by piles driven in vertically. In many cases
notches had evidently been made, the better to place the cross-beams;
whilst in others <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3520" href=
"#xd21e3520" name="xd21e3520">154</a>]</span>forked branches had been
selected, so that a second branch could be fitted into the fork.
Primeval man soon learnt to appreciate the solidity of such a
combination. Do these stations, however, really date from prehistoric
times? Virchow, returning to his first opinion, now thinks that the
pile dwellings of Germany belong to the same epoch as the intrenchments
known as <i>Burgwallen</i>, when metals and even iron were already in
general use. They were inhabited until the thirteenth century, and it
is easy to trace in them, as in those of Switzerland, the signs of the
successive occupations, the dwellings having evidently been abandoned
and restored later by fresh comers.</p>

<p>At the meeting of the British Association at Newcastle in 1863, Lord
Lovaine described a Lake Station in the south of Scotland, and Sir J.
Lubbock mentions one in the north of England. Others are known at
Holderness (Yorkshire), at Thetford, on Barton Mere, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3532" href="#xd21e3532" name=
"xd21e3532">155</a>]</span>near Bury St. Edmunds; but judging from the
description of them they are not of earlier date than the Bronze
age.</p>
<p>Other stations are more ancient. A few years ago a number of piles
were found a little above Kew, beneath a layer of alluvium, and
embedded in the gravel which formed the ancient bed of the Thames. All
around these piles were scattered the bones of animals, of which those
of the <i>Bos longifrons</i> were the most remarkable. The long bones
had been split to get out the marrow, an evident proof of the
intelligent action of man. In London two similar examples were found on
the site of the present Mansion House, and beneath the ancient walls of
the city. They are supposed to date from times earlier, not only than
the cutting out of the present course of the Thames, but before that
invasion of the sea which preceded the formation of the Thames valley,
now the home of more than four million men and women.</p>
<p>The Lake Stations of France are less important than those of the
neighboring countries. It is supposed that Vatan, a little town of
Berry, was built on the site of a Lake city. It is situated in the
midst of a dried-up marsh, and at different points piles have been
removed which were driven deep into the mud. We also hear of pile
dwellings in the Jura Mountains, in the Pyrenean valleys of
Haute-Garonne, Ari&egrave;ge, and Aude, as well as in those of the
Eastern Pyrenees. In the department of Landes, which on one side joins
the plateau of Lannemezan, and on the other the lofty plains of
B&eacute;arn, are many marshy depressions, where have been found
numbers of piles, with charred wood and fragments of pottery.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3542" href="#xd21e3542" name=
"xd21e3542">156</a>]</span></p>
<p>Discoveries no less curious have been made in the Bourget Lake, but
the dwellings rising from its surface date from a comparatively recent
epoch. The numerous fragments of pottery found prove that terra-cotta
ware had attained to a beauty of form and color unknown to primitive
times. Indeed some of the vases actually bear the name of the Roman
potter who made them. We must also assign to an epoch later than the
Stone age the buildings, remains of which have beet found in the
peat-bogs of Saint-Dos near Salies (Basses-Pyr&eacute;n&eacute;es). At
a depth of about thirty-two inches has been found a regular floor
formed of trunks of trees resting on piles and bound together in a
primitive fashion with the filaments of roots. These piles bear a
number of deep clean-cut notches, such as could only have been made
with an iron implement. <span class="corr" id="xd21e3545" title=
"Source: in">In</span> other parts of France there are Lake Stations,
which were occupied until the time of the Carlovingians. To this time
belong the pile dwellings of Lake Paladru (Is&egrave;re), which were
abandoned, so far as we can tell, by their owners when they were
swamped by the rising of the water.</p>
<p>When the Lake Stations of Europe were inhabited, the characteristic
animals of the Quaternary epoch, such as the elephant, the rhinoceros,
the lion, and the hippopotamus had disappeared from that continent, and
their place was taken by the earliest domestic animals. The Lake fauna
of Switzerland includes about seventy species, thirty mammals
twenty-six birds, ten kinds of fish, and four reptiles.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3550src" href="#xd21e3550" name=
"xd21e3550src">15</a> The mammals were the stag, the dog, the pig, the
goat, the sheep, and two kinds of oxen. These animals were <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3553" href="#xd21e3553" name=
"xd21e3553">157</a>]</span>already domesticated, there can be
absolutely no doubt on this point, for in many <i>Pfahlbauten</i> their
very dung has been found, a conclusive proof that they lived side by
side with man.</p>
<p>The remains of the stag and of the ox are more numerous than those
of any other animal, and it is easy to see that every clay the
importance of a pastoral life became more clearly recognized. In the
most ancient Lake Stations, those of Mooseedorf, Wangen, and Meilen,
for instance, the stag predominates; in those of the western lakes,
which are comparatively more recent, relics of the ox are more
numerous. In the Lake village of Nidau, which dates from the Bronze
age, a greatly increased number of bones of domestic animals have been
found, whilst those of wild creatures become rarer and rarer. The
progress of domestication is evident, and it is no less certain that
the lapse of centuries must have been required for the formation of the
herds which evidently existed in certain localities. It is possible
that these animals may have first entered Europe in the wake of foreign
invaders, and before being reduced to servitude, they may have roamed
about in a wild state, and even have been contemporaries with species
now extinct. However that may be, there can be no doubt on one point,
they could not domesticate themselves; one race of creatures after
another must have fallen under the subjection of man, who gradually
became the master of all the animals that are still about us.</p>
<p>We do not meet in the pile dwellings with the common mouse, the rat,
or the cat, and the horse is very rare. It is the same with the
kitchen-middings and the caves occupied in Neolithic times. The
disappearance <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3562" href=
"#xd21e3562" name="xd21e3562">158</a>]</span>of the horse, so numerous
in earlier epochs, is general, and this would be inexplicable if
history did not solve the mystery. The Bible, which gives us such
complete details of the pastoral life of the Hebrews, speaks for the
first time of the horse after the exodus from Egypt of the children of
Israel, and in Egypt itself the horse is not represented in any
monument of earlier date than the Seventeenth Dynasty. It is the same
in America, animals of the equine race, that were so numerous in early
geological times, had long since disappeared on the arrival of the
Spaniards, and the horses they brought with them inspired the Mexicans
and Peruvians with unutterable terror.</p>
<p>Domestic animals require regular food through the long winter
months; so that their presence alone is enough to prove that their
owners were tillers of the soil. The discovery in many of the Helvetian
Lake Stations of calcined cereals confirms this hypothesis. Amongst the
cereals found, corn is the most abundant, and several bushels of it
have been collected. In the department of the Gironde, regular silos or
subterranean storing-places for grain have been found in which the
calcined corn was stowed away. In the Lake Stations have also been
found millet, peas, poppy-heads, nuts, plums, raspberries, and even
dried apples and pears, doubtless set aside as a provision for the
winter. From the water at Cortaillod, have been taken, with a few ears
of barley, cherry-stones, acorns, and beechnuts<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3566src" href="#xd21e3566" name="xd21e3566src">16</a>; and at
Laybach, some water-chestnuts (<i>trapa natans</i>) of a kind that has
long since disappeared from Carniola. Sometimes the cereals were
roughly roasted, crushed, and put away in large earthenware vessels;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3574" href="#xd21e3574" name=
"xd21e3574">159</a>]</span>but in some places, regular flat round
loaves of bread have been found about one or two inches thick, which
were baked without leaven. We may well assert that great changes lead
taken place since the first arrival of man upon the earth.</p>
<p>The so-called <i>terremares</i> of Italy date from the same period
as the Danish kitchen-middings and the Swiss pile dwellings. They are
met with chiefly in Lombardy and in the ancient duchies of Parma and
Piacenza, and consist of low mounds rising from thirteen to sixteen
feet above the surface of the soil. In some cases a number of
<i>terremares</i>, close to one another, form regular villages covering
an area of from five to six miles square. Excavations of the
<i>terremare</i> have brought to light rows of piles from seven to ten
feet long, connected by transverse beams, forming a regular floor, from
which rose huts built in a similar way to those of the Swiss pile
dwellings, of interlaced branches or of clay and straw, for no trace
has been made out of the use of bricks or of stones. The refuse of the
kitchen and rubbish of all kinds rapidly accumulated round about these
huts, and formed the first nucleus of the mound, which soon grew to a
considerable height as one occupant of the house succeeded another.
When the refuse became too much of a nuisance, the owner of the but set
up fresh piles at a greater height on the same site, laid down another
platform, and built anew but. In some places three such platforms have
been found one above another.</p>
<p>As in the Lake Stations, excavations of the <i>terremares</i> have
brought to light numerous bones of domestic animals; but those of wild
creatures, such as bears, stags, roedeer, and boars, are even rarer
than in Switzerland. The inhabitants evidently had other resources
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3592" href="#xd21e3592" name=
"xd21e3592">160</a>]</span>than hunting at their command, and though
the processes they employed were but elementary, they cultivated corn,
beans, vines, and various fruits. Though iron was still unknown, some
bronze objects have been found in certain <i>terremares</i>, but these
were only roughly melted pieces of metal, showing no traces of having
been either hammered or soldered. Amongst the pottery found in the
<i>terremares</i>, we must mention a number of small objects not unlike
acorns in form, pierced lengthwise, and decorated with incised lines,
some straight, others curved. Italian arch&aelig;ologists call them
<i>fusa&iuml;oles</i>, and Swiss savants, who have found a great many
in the lakes of their native country, give them the name of <i>pesons
de fuseau</i>. Both these names connect them with the process of
spinning; but their number renders this hypothesis inadmissible, and
when we give an account of the excavations carried on at Hissarlik,
under Dr. Schliemann, we shall be able to determine their character
(see <a href="#ch7">Chapter VII</a>.).</p>
<p>At Castione, near the town of Parma, and in several other parts of
the provinces of Parma and Reggio, <i>terremares</i> have been
discovered rising from the midst of vast rectangular basins
artificially hollowed out. Some have concluded from this that the
<i>terremarecolli</i> as the inhabitants of the <i>terremares</i> have
been called, were descended from the people who built the pile
dwellings of Switzerland, and that, faithful to the traditions of their
race, they hollowed out ponds in default of natural lakes. If this were
so, Italy must have been peopled with a race that came over the
Alps.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3621src" href="#xd21e3621" name=
"xd21e3621src">17</a> Who or what this race was can only be matter
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3637" href="#xd21e3637" name=
"xd21e3637">161</a>]</span>of conjecture. It cannot, however, have been
the Ligures, a branch of the great Iberian family, who were totally
ignorant of culture, and to whom the builders of the most ancient of
the <i>terremares</i> were certainly superior; nor can it have been the
Etruscans, for all relics of that race, which are moreover easily
recognizable, were found quite apart from the deep deposits containing
the <i>terremares</i>. Many indications point to the conclusion that
when the Celts came down into Italy their knowledge of metallurgy was
already more advanced than that of the builders of the
<i>terremares</i>. We are therefore disposed to think with Heilbig,
that the <i>terremarecolli</i> were the Itali, of Arian race, who were
the ancestors of the Sabini, Umbri, Osci, and Latins. In the great
migrations of races, the Itali bad separated themselves from their
brethren the Pelasgi, who had remained in Epirus, and, continuing their
march, they peopled Switzerland and crossed the Alps, settling down in
the fertile plains watered by the Po, where it is easy even now to
prove their presence.</p>
<p>In superintending the excavation of a <i>terremare</i> at Toszig, in
Hungary, Pigorini,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3657src" href=
"#xd21e3657" name="xd21e3657src">18</a> was greatly struck by the
resemblance between it and similar erections in Italy, especially that
of Casarolo. This is very much in favor of the Itali having been the
builders. But the objects collected in some of the <i>terremares</i>,
those of Varano and Chierici for instance, prove that they were
inhabited from Neolithic times, so that the Itali of Italy, if Itali
they were, did but follow the traditions of their predecessors. In
spite, however, of zealous study, all that relates to the origin of
tribes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3671" href="#xd21e3671" name=
"xd21e3671">162</a>]</span>and races remains involved in the greatest
obscurity, and we can but look to the future to supply what the present
altogether fails to give.</p>
<p>We have yet other tokens of the presence of the ancient races who
peopled Italy. Dr. Concezio Rosa<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3675src"
href="#xd21e3675" name="xd21e3675src">19</a> noticed in the Abruzzi
extensive black patches on the ground, which bore witness to the former
residence of men. The excavation of these <i>Fondi di Cabane</i>, as
they are called, led to the finding of a great many stone knives and
scrapers with numerous bone stilettos and the bones of various animals,
all of them of species still living. Later, similar <i>fondi</i> were
found between the Eastern Alps and Mount Gargano. In Reggio, at
Rivaltella, at Castelnuovo de Sotto, and at Calerno, they formed
regular groups, and from one of these stations more than one thousand
worked flints were collected. We mention them especially because they
were of lozenge (<i>selci romboidali</i>) and half-lozenge
(<i>semi-rombi</i>) shapes, which are forms unknown in other
districts.</p>
<p>With these flints were hand-made vases with handles, the clay
unmixed with sand or quartz and ornamented with lines, grooves, and
raised knobs. These vases differ greatly from those found in the
<i>terremares</i>; are they then, as has been said, of earlier date? It
is impossible to come to any decision on the point.</p>
<p>Before closing our account of prehistoric buildings surrounded by
water, we must say a few words on crannoges though there is the
greatest difference of opinion as to their date.</p>
<p>Crannoges are artificial islets raised above the level of certain
lakes in Ireland and Scotland<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3703src" href=
"#xd21e3703" name="xd21e3703src">20</a> by means of a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3712" href="#xd21e3712" name=
"xd21e3712">163</a>]</span>series of layers of earth and stone, and
strengthened by piles, some upright, others laid down lengthwise. Wylde
counted forty-six in Ireland in his time, some of them of considerable
extent. That of Ardkellin Lough (Roscommon) is surrounded by a wall of
dry stones resting on piles. In other places have been found the
remains of stockades very intelligently set up in such a manner as to
break the force of the shock of the water.</p>
<p>To add to the difficulties of dealing with the subject of crannoges,
they were successively occupied for many centuries. They are mentioned
in the most ancient Irish legends, and even in the sixteenth century
they served as refuges for the kings of the country in the constant
rebellions that took place. The objects taken from the lakes belong to
very different epochs, and it is impossible to say anything positive as
to the time of their construction.</p>
<p>A but found in Donegal may, however, date from an extremely remote
age.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3718src" href="#xd21e3718" name=
"xd21e3718src">21</a> It rested on a thick layer of sand brought front
the neighboring shore, and was covered over by a bed of peat slot less
than sixteen feet thick. Since the hilt was deserted by man the peat
had gradually accumulated till it had at last invaded the dwelling
itself. The but included a ground-floor, and one story about twelve
feet long by nine wide and four high. The walls consisted of beams
scarcely squared, joined together with wooden mortices and pegs. The
roof, which was probably flat, consisted of oak planks, the spaces
between which had been filled in with mortar made of sand and grease.
On the ground-floor lay several flint <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e3726" href="#xd21e3726" name=
"xd21e3726">164</a>]</span>implements, showing no signs of having been
polished, a quartz wedge, and a stone chisel, which had evidently seen
long service. This chisel, the discoverers say, corresponded exactly
with the notches around the mortices. A regular paved way, formed of
sea-beach pebbles placed on a foundation of interlaced branches, led up
to a hearth made of flat stones measuring some three feet every way.
All about lay fragments of charcoal and broken nuts, the latter partly
burnt. Another but, with an oak floor resting on four posts, has
recently been discovered in County Fermanagh, beneath a deposit of peat
about twenty feet thick. No trace of metal has been found in either of
these Irish huts, and the thickness of the peat beneath which they lay
is another proof of their great antiquity. One serious objection,
however, is this: Were the Irish sufficiently advanced in prehistoric
times to be able to erect dwellings implying so considerable an amount
of civilization?</p>
<p>Crannoges are met with in Scotland as well as in Ireland, and
excavations in Loch Lee have enabled explorers to make out their mode
of construction. The Lake Dwellers began by piling up a number of
trunks of trees in the shallower waters of a lake. They then
strengthened these trunks with branches or beams about which the mud
collected till the whole formed an islet. All about this islet, beneath
the waters of the lake, were found various objects in stone, wood, and
horn, as well as some canoes several feet long. Similar crannoges are
to be seen on the lakes of Kincardine and Forfar, which Troyon thinks
date from the Stone age.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3730src" href=
"#xd21e3730" name="xd21e3730src">22</a> If he be right, and we should
not like to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3733" href="#xd21e3733"
name="xd21e3733">165</a>]</span>make any assertion one way or the
other, the bronze objects and the enamelled glass bowls found near
these dwellings prove that they were occupied by several successive
generations.</p>
<p>It is probable that Lake dwellings were also used in Asia and in
Africa from prehistoric times. History tells us that the inhabitants of
Phasis, the Mingrelians of the present day, lived in reed huts on the
water, and that they went from one islet to another in canoes hollowed
out of the trunks of oak-trees. A bas-relief from the palace of
Sennacherib, preserved in the British Museum, represents warriors
fighting on artificial islands made of large reeds. But here w e enter
the domain of history, and we must return to Neolithic times, and speak
of the habitations built of more durable materials and the ruins of
which are still standing.</p>
<p>It is impossible to say with any certainty to what period the most
ancient of these structures belong. It is probable that man early
learned to pile up stones, binding them together at first with clay,
and then with some stronger cements. The <i>burghs</i> of Scotland, the
<i>nurhags</i> of the island of Sardinia, the <i>talayoti</i> of the
Balearic Isles, the <i>castellieri</i> of Istria, are all ancient
witnesses of the modes of building employed in the most remote
ages.</p>
<p><i>Burghs, brocks</i>, or <i>broughs</i> are numerous in
Scotland,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3758src" href="#xd21e3758" name=
"xd21e3758src">23</a> and also in the islands of the Atlantic. For a
long time they were supposed to be of Scandinavian origin, but Sir J.
Lubbock<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3761src" href="#xd21e3761" name=
"xd21e3761src">24</a> remarks With reason that no <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3764" href="#xd21e3764" name=
"xd21e3764">166</a>]</span>building at all like them exists in Norway
or in Denmark, and it is difficult to admit the idea that the
Scandinavians set up in the islands tributary to them buildings which
were unknown to their own mainland. We are therefore disposed to think
that these curious structures, which were inhabited until the twelfth
and thirteenth centuries of the Christian era, are of much earlier date
than the first invasion by the Northmen, and that the burgh still
standing on the little island of Moussa, one of the Shetlands, is one
of the best examples that we can quote. A tower, forty-one feet high,
rises on the borders of the sea. The walls are of unhewn stones, piled
up without cement, and they form two circles, separated by a passage
four feet wide. In each story are a series of very small openings,
intended to admit air and light to the cell-like rooms inside, and to a
staircase that leads to the top of the tower. The only way into this
burgh is through a door only seven feet high, and so narrow that it is
impossible for two people to go in abreast.</p>
<p>The regularity of the building of this burgh, and the architectural
knowledge it implies, prevent our ascribing it either to the Stone or
even to the Bronze age; but we find in Scotland itself more ancient
examples, if we may so express ourselves, of domestic architecture.
These examples are subterranean dwellings, made of rough-hewn stones of
considerable size, laid down in regular courses, to which the names of
<i>earth-houses, Picts&rsquo; houses</i>, and <i>weems</i> have been
given. The walls converge towards the centre, leaving an opening at the
top, which was covered in with large flat stones. These dwellings are
certainly of earlier date than the burghs, and the discovery of a
<i>Picts&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3776" href=
"#xd21e3776" name="xd21e3776">167</a>]</span>house</i> actually beneath
the ruins of a burgh enables us to speak with certainty on this
point.</p>
<p>In Ireland similar proofs have been found of the great antiquity of
roan. More than one hundred towers have been found in that country, all
built of large stones, and varying in height from seventy to one
hundred and thirty feet, with a diameter of from eight to fifteen feet.
The most diverse origins have been attributed to these towers, from
prehistoric times to the centuries immediately preceding the Christian
era; from the time of the Druids to that of the Friars. According to
the point of view of different arch&aelig;ologists, they have been
called temples of the sun, hermitages, phallic monuments, or signal
towers.</p>
<p>We meet with a similar problem in considering the <i>nurhags</i>, as
in considering the burghs. They have been justly called a page of
history, written all over the surface of Sardinia by an unknown people.
Count Albert de la Marmora counted three thousand of them a few years
ago, and more recent explorers tell us that this number is greatly
exceeded. Like the burghs, which they strangely resemble, the
<i>nurhags</i> are conical towers with very thick walls made of huge
stones, some Hewn, others in their natural state, arranged in regular
courses without mortar. On entering one of them we find ourselves in a
vaulted room, which looks exactly like one half of an egg in shape. In
the upper stories are two, and sometimes three rooms, one above the
other, to which access is gained by steps cut in the walls. The whole
structure is crowned by a terrace (<a href="#fig053">Fig. 53</a>). We
must add that the entrance to the <i>nurhag</i> is through an opening
on a level with the ground, and so low that one can only go in by
crawling on the stomach. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3796" href=
"#xd21e3796" name="xd21e3796">168</a>]</span></p>
<p>Many conjectures have been made as to the use of these towers. Were
they temples in which to worship, or trophies of victory? Their number
is against either of these hypotheses. Were they then habitations or
towers of observation? Not the former certainly, for no one could live
between walls sixteen or twenty-two feet thick, shut out from air and
light. Some travellers think they were tombs, but excavations have
brought to light no bones or sepulchral relics. We can compare them to
nothing but the Towers of Silence, on which the Parsees expose their
dead to the birds of heaven, which are ever ready rapidly to acquit
themselves of their melancholy functions.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e3800width" id="fig053"><img src=
"images/fig053.jpg" alt="" width="242" height="173">
<p class="first">Nurhag at Santa Barbara (Sardinia).</p>
</div>
<p>The origin of the <i>nurhags</i> is as uncertain as their use.
Diodorus Siculus considered them very ancient, and one fact has come to
light in our day which enables us to arrive at a somewhat more exact
decision. The island of Sardinia was taken by the Romans from the
Carthaginians in 238 B.C., and an <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e3809" href="#xd21e3809" name="xd21e3809">169</a>]</span>aqueduct,
the ruins of which can still be seen, was built by the conquerors on
the foundations of an ancient <i>nurhag</i>, so that the latter must
belong to an earlier date than the third century before our era.
Fergusson, who speaks with authority on everything relating to the
monuments of the Stone age, assigns the <i>nurhags</i> to the mystic
times of the Trojan War. In all probability they were built by an
invading people. La Marmora thinks these invaders were the Libyans; M.
de Rougemont, in his history of the Bronze age, says that the curved
vault is the characteristic feature of Pelasgian architecture, which is
often confounded with that of the Ph&oelig;nicians. Although any final
conclusion would be premature, we ourselves think that the builders of
the <i>nurhags</i> belonged to the great stream of emigration from the
East, the course of which is marked by megalithic monuments in so many
parts of the world. In some instances, <i>nurhags</i> were surrounded
by cromlechs, of which most of the stones have now been thrown down.
Some of these stones bore prominences resembling the breasts of a
woman.</p>
<p>The accumulations of earth and rubbish about the <i>nurhags</i> are,
some of them, from six to ten feet high. In the lower deposits have
been found coarse pottery, with no attempt at ornamentation, fragments
of flint, and obsidian hatchets of black basalt, or porphyry of the
Pal&aelig;olithic type, arrow-head, flint knives, stones used in
slings, and numerous shells; whilst in the upper deposits were picked
up black pottery and fragments of bronze belonging to the transition
period between the Stone and Metal ages.</p>
<p>All over the island of Sardinia, side by side with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3831" href="#xd21e3831" name=
"xd21e3831">170</a>]</span>the <i>nurhags</i>, rise tombs to which have
been given the name of <i lang="it">Sepolture dei Giganti</i>. They are
from thirty-two to thirty-nine feet long by a nearly equal width, and
are built, some of huge slabs of stone, some of stones of smaller size.
They are in every case surmounted by a pediment, formed of a single
block, and often covered with sculptures dating from different epochs.
These sepulchres are certainly of later date than the <i>nurhags</i>,
and in them have been found numerous implements of bronze, but none of
stone.</p>

<p class="first">&ldquo;Talayoti&rdquo; at Trepuco (Minorca).</p>
</div>
<p>The <i>talayoti</i>, of which one hundred and fifty are still
standing in the island of Minorca, are circular or elliptical truncated
cones, built of huge unhewn stones, laid one on the other without
cement (<a href="#fig054">Fig. 54</a>). The most remarkable of all of
them, that at Torello, near Mahon, is thirty-three feet high. In many
cases there are two stone, one placed upright, the other across it, in
front of the <i>talayoti</i>. The meaning of these biliths is
unknown.</p>
<p>Yet another series of cyclopean monuments are known under the name
of <i>nanetas</i>, and are not unlike <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e3863" href="#xd21e3863" name=
"xd21e3863">171</a>]</span>overturned boats. Seven such <i>nanetas</i>
are still to be seen in the Balearic Isles. The one which is best
preserved consists of large unhewn stones of rectangular shape,
enclosing an inner chamber about six feet in width. The roof having
fallen in, its height cannot be exactly determined; we only know that
the lateral walls are some forty-five feet high.</p>
<p>In Algeria also have been preserved some towers built of stones
without cement. Some of them are square (<i>basina</i>) and surmounted
by a small dolmen, others are round (<i>chouchet</i>) and closed at the
top by a large slab of stone, as in the <i>nurhags</i> we have just
described.</p>
<p>It is difficult to bring this account to a close without mentioning
the <i>truddhi</i> and the <i>specchie</i> of Otranto.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3887src" href="#xd21e3887" name=
"xd21e3887src">25</a> A <i><span class="corr" id="xd21e3903" title=
"Source: truddhu">truddhi</span></i> is a massive conical tower
consisting of a heap of scarcely hewn stones piled up without cement
and with an exterior facing. Inside is a round room, the roof of which
is formed by a series of circular courses of stone projecting one
beyond the other. Sometimes a second chamber rises above the first,
which <i>is</i> reached by steps cut in the facing, which steps also
lead to the platform on the top of the tower. Thousands of
<i>truddhi</i> are to be seen in Italy; they date from every epoch, and
the people of Lecce and Bari continue to erect them as did their
fathers before them. Side by side with the <i>truddhi</i> rise the
<i>specchie</i>, which are conical masses of stone, of greater height
and probably of more ancient date than the towers. Lenormant thinks
they were used to live in; but his opinion has <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3919" href="#xd21e3919" name=
"xd21e3919">172</a>]</span>been much questioned, and it is necessary to
speak on this point with great reserve.</p>
<p>The <i>castellieri</i> of Istria, which the Slavonian peasants call
<i>starigrad</i>, are as yet but little known. Doubtless an examination
of them will bring out their resemblance to the <i>nurhags</i> and
<i>talayoti</i>. They are, however, more than mere towers, forming
regular <i>enceintes</i> between walls formed of two facings of dry
stones, the space between which is filled in with smaller stones. There
are fifteen of these <i>castellieri</i> in the district of Albona, a
little town on the southeast of Trieste. They were at first attributed
to the Roman epoch, but later researches relegate them rather to
prehistoric times, and the discovery near them of numerous stone
implements rather tends to support this latter opinion, but it must not
be considered conclusive.</p>
<p>Perhaps we ought also to connect with the earliest ages of humanity
the stations recently discovered in Spain by MM. Siret.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3945src" href="#xd21e3945" name=
"xd21e3945src">26</a> These were evidently centres of population,
surrounded by walls of a very primitive description. We shall have to
refer again to these discoveries; we will only add now that in the
black earth forming the soil were found worked flints, polished diorite
hatchets, pierced shells, with various pieces of pottery, and mills for
grinding corn. So far, however though many of the stations have been
explored, no trace has been found of the use of metals.</p>
<p>A vast period of time, countless centuries, indeed, have passed away
since the close of the Paleolithic epoch. The burghs, <i>nurhags</i>,
and <i>castellieri</i> show the progress of civilization, and at the
same time prove that this progress extended throughout Europe, and that
at <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3956" href="#xd21e3956" name=
"xd21e3956">173</a>]</span>a time not so very far removed from our own.
The close resemblance between buildings of different dates enables us
to speak with certainty of the connection between the races which
succeeded each other in Europe. The importance of these conclusions is
very great, and will be brought out still more in our study of
megalithic monuments. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3958" href=

<h2 class="main">Megalithic Monuments.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Megalithic monuments are perhaps the most interesting
of all the witnesses of the remote past, into the history of which we
are now inquiring, and of which so little is known. From the shores of
the Atlantic to the Ural Mountains, from the frontiers of Russia to the
Pacific Ocean, from the steppes of Siberia to the plains of Hindustan,
we see rising before us monuments of the same characteristic form,
built in the same manner. This is a very important fact in the history
of humanity, and of which it is difficult to exaggerate the
importance.</p>
<p>What is the age of all these monuments? Were they all erected by one
race, which has thus carried on its traditions front one generation to
another? Were they the temples of the gods of this race, or the tombs
of their ancestors? Did the people who set them up come from the East,
or did they come from the North, on their way to the warmer regions of
the South? These and many other questions are eagerly discussed, but in
the present state of our knowledge not one of them call be answered in
a perfectly satisfactory manner. <i>Scire ignorare magna scientia</i>,
said an ancient philosopher, and this is a truth which we must often
repeat when we are dealing with prehistoric times. <span class=

<p class="first">Dolmen of Castle Wellan (Ireland).</p>
</div>
<p>Under the name of megalithic monuments we include <i>tumuli,
dolmens, cromlechs, menhirs</i>, and <i>covered avenues</i>. It may at
first sight appear strange to include tumuli amongst stone monuments,
but they almost always enclose a dolmen, a cist, or a crypt
communicating with the outside by a covered passage. The excavation of
more than four hundred tumuli in England has brought to light now, a
stone coffer made of a number of stones set edgeways and called a
<i>kistvaen</i>: now of a, tomb hollowed out beneath the surface of the
ground, and enclosed by huge blocks of stone.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3990src" href="#xd21e3990" name="xd21e3990src">1</a> Mounds are
as numerous in Portugal as tumuli in England, and the fact that they
are of low height has led to their being called <i>mamoas</i> or
<i>maminhas</i>, which signifies little mounds. In Poland, tumuli
consist of piles of massive stones; beneath each is a cist made of four
large slabs, and containing as many as eight or ten urns full of
calcined bones. The excavation of a tumulus in the plain of Tarbes
brought to light an enormous block of granite resting on blocks of
quartz. The spaces between these blocks were filled in with rubble made
of small stones cemented into one mass with clay. Edwin-Harness Mound,
near Liberty (Ohio), is 160 feet long by eighty or ninety wide, and
thirteen to eighteen high in the middle. It contained a dozen
sepulchral chambers.</p>

<p class="first">The large dolmen of Coreoro, near Plouharnel.</p>
</div>
<p>More rarely tumuli are merely artificial mounds of earth, sometimes
rising to a great height. Those of North America are the most
remarkable known. That of Cahokia is now ninety-one feet high,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4007src" href="#xd21e4007" name="xd21e4007src">2</a>
and was formerly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4010" href=
"#xd21e4010" name="xd21e4010">177</a>]</span>surmounted by a low
pyramid, now destroyed. Its base measures 560 feet by 720, the platform
at the top is 146 feet by 310 feet wide, and it has been estimated that
twenty-five million cubic feet of earth were used in its construction.
Major Pearse mentions a tumulus near Nagpore, which is 3,900 feet in
circumference, and 174 feet high. Another between Tyre and Sarepta, is
130 feet high by 650 in diameter. It has never been excavated.<a class=

<p class="first">Dolmen of Arrayolos (Portugal).</p>
</div>
<p>The dolmen type of monument is a rectangle of u hewn upright stones
covered over with a slab laid across them; this slab being the largest
block of stone that could be found in the neighborhood or obtained by
the builders.</p>
<p>Dolmens are generally found either on the top of a natural or an
artificial mound, in the middle of a plain, or on the banks of a
watercourse. We must mention, amongst others, those in Persia, which
are some 7,000 <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4024" href=
"#xd21e4024" name="xd21e4024">178</a>]</span>feet high and from
twenty-one to twenty-six feet long by six wide; that near Myken&aelig;,
that of Aum&egrave;de-Bas, excavated by Dr. Pruni&egrave;res; that of
New Grange, in Ireland, surmounted by a cromlech of stones of
considerable size, many of them brought from a distance; that of
Hellstone, near Dorchester, consisting of nine upright stones
supporting a table more than twenty-seven and a half feet in
circumference, seven feet wide and two and a half thick. The dolmens
near Saturnia, one of the most ancient Etruscan towns, include a
quadrangular room, sunk some feet into the earth, and having walls made
of blocks of stone and a roof of a couple of large slabs, sloped
slightly to let the rain run off. We give illustrations of the dolmens
of Castle Wellan in Ireland (<a href="#fig055">Fig. 55</a>), of Coreoro
near Plouharnel (Morbihan) (<a href="#fig056">Fig. 56</a>), of
Arrayolos in Portugal (<a href="#fig057">Fig. 57</a>), and Acora in
Peru (<a href="#fig058">Fig. 58</a>), which will enable the reader to
judge of the different modes of construction employed in building these
megalithic monuments.</p>

"images/fig058.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="144">
<p class="first">Megalithic sepulchre at Acora (Peru).</p>
</div>
<p>In some cases the dolmen, which alone is visible from without, is
placed upon a mound, covering a hidden <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e4046" href="#xd21e4046" name=
"xd21e4046">179</a>]</span>sepulchral chamber, whilst in others the
crypt is replaced by a simple stone cist, generally of rectangular
shape. We may mention in this connection the dolmen of Bekour-Noz at
St. Pierre Quiberon, which is remarkable for its great size, and rises
from the midst of a cemetery in which a great many coffins have been
found. The bones they contained were unfortunately dispersed at the
time of their discovery.</p>
<p>Dolmens are scattered about in great numbers in the Kouban basin and
all along the coasts of the Black Sea occupied by the Tcherkesses.
These curious vestiges of an unknown civilization are still an unsolved
enigma to us, as are those of Western Europe; they are generally formed
of four upright slabs surmounted by a fifth laid horizontally, and one
of the supporting slabs is nearly always pierced with a small round or
oval opening. Excavations have brought to light arrow-heads, rings, and
bronze spirals, but Chantre, an authority of considerable weight, and
who has moreover had the advantage of actually seeing these megalithic
monuments of the south of Russia, attributes the objects found beneath
them to secondary interments, and does not hesitate in assigning the
more ancient monuments themselves to the Stone age. We must not omit to
mention the dolmens found in the southern portion of the island of Yezo
(Japan),<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4050src" href="#xd21e4050" name=
"xd21e4050src">4</a> nor that described by Darwin at Puerto Deseado
(Patagonia). They are both very similar to those of Europe.</p>
<p>To resume, dolmens, called <i>H&uuml;nengr&auml;ber</i> in Germany,
<i>stazzona</i> in Corsica, <i>antas</i> in Portugal, and
<i>stendos</i> in Sweden, have all alike one large flat horizontal slab
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4073" href="#xd21e4073" name=
"xd21e4073">180</a>]</span>placed on two or more upright unhewn stones.
This is the one fixed rule; local circumstances, perhaps even the
caprice of the builders, decided the position and the mode of erection.
Often, as I have already remarked, dolmens are buried beneath tumuli,
but exceptions to this are numerous. General Faidherbe, after having
examined more than six thousand dolmens in Algeria, affirms that the
greater number have never been covered with earth.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e4076src" href="#xd21e4076" name="xd21e4076src">5</a> In the
Orkney Islands there are more than one hundred dolmens without tumuli,
and Martinet failed to find any trace of mounds in Berry. In Scotland
and Brittany we find dolmens buried, not beneath mounds of earth, but
under accumulations of pebbles, called <i>cairns</i> in Scotland and
<i>galgals</i> in Brittany. However minor details may vary, and they do
vary infinitely, one main idea everywhere dominated the builders, and
that was the desire to protect from all profanation the resting-place
of what had once been a human being.</p>
<p>Cromlechs are circles of upright stones often surrounding dolmens or
tumuli. Sometimes they form single circles, and at others two, three,
or even seven separate enclosures. They are common in Algeria, Sweden,
and Denmark, and in the last-named country two kinds are distinguished:
the <i>langdyssers</i>, which form an ellipse, and the
<i>rundyssers</i> which form a perfect circle. In other countries
cromlechs are slot so numerous; there are but few in France, of which
we may name those of Kergoman (Morbihan), Lestridion in Plomeur, and
Landaondec in Crozon (Finist&egrave;re). The last-named, known its
<i>le temple des faux dieux</i>, is closed by a double row of small
menhirs. In Italy, the only <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4096"
href="#xd21e4096" name="xd21e4096">181</a>]</span>cromlechs known are
those of Sesto-Calende and those of the plateau of Mallevalle near
Ticino. One of the latter still retains in their original position
fifty-nine huge granite blocks, forming a circular enceinte, a
semicircle, and an entrance avenue. A few leagues from the ancient Tyre
can still be seen a circle of upright stones. Ouseley describes another
at Darab, in Persia; a missionary speaks of three large circles at
Khabb, in Arabia, which circles he compares with those at Stonehenge;
and Dr. Barth tells us of a cromlech between Mourzouk and
Gh&acirc;t.</p>
<p>A kurgan, or tumulus, leaving been opened in the Kherson district,
three or four concentric circles were discovered beneath it,
surrounding a structure of considerable size.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4100src" href="#xd21e4100" name="xd21e4100src">6</a> The cromlech
of Anajapoura in Ceylon, probably, however, erected comparatively
recently, consists of fifty-two granite pillars, about thirteen feet
high, encircling a Buddhist temple. At Peshawur is another circle,
fourteen of the stones of which are still upright, whilst traces can be
made out of an outer enceinte of smaller stones; in Peru there are
several cromlechs, whilst others have been found at the foot of
Elephant Mount, in the desert plains of Australia. The last-named vary
from ten to one thousand feet in diameter, but excavations beneath them
have brought to light only a few human bones.</p>
<p>At Mzora, in Morocco, the traveller will notice a mound of
elliptical shape, some 21 or 22&frac12; feet high, flanked on the west
by a group of menhirs, and surrounded by an enceinte of upright stones
which now <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4119" href="#xd21e4119"
name="xd21e4119">182</a>]</span>number about forty. In 1831, there were
still ninety, and on the south side were noticed two round pillars
parallel with each other, which probably formed an entrance.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4121src" href="#xd21e4121" name="xd21e4121src">7</a>
This group evidently originally formed the centre of a series of
megalithic monuments, for on the north and southwest some fifty
monoliths can still be made out, some still erect, others
fallen.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4124src" href="#xd21e4124" name=
"xd21e4124src">8</a></p>
<p>It was in Great Britain, however, that cromlechs appear to have
reached their highest development. That of Salkeld in Cumberland
includes sixty-seven menhirs; that near Loch Stemster in Caithness,
thirty-three, whilst in Westmoreland, <i>Long Meg and her daughters</i>
are still the objects of superstitious reverence. The remains at
Avebury are among the most remarkable prehistoric monuments still
extant, and evidently originally formed part of a most important group.
This group had an outer rampart of earth, with a ditch on the inner
side, within which was a circle of upright stones, probably numbering
as many as one hundred. Within this circle were two others of smaller
size, each in its turn enclosing yet another circle of upright stones.
In the middle of one of these inner circles, that on the north, was a
dolmen, whilst that on the south enclosed in the centre but a single
upright menhir. The stones used in constructing these various groups
were all such as are still to be found on the Wiltshire downs. From the
southeastern portion of the extensive earthen rampart, a stone avenue
extended for a considerable distance in a perfectly straight line, and
is still known as Kennet&rsquo;s Avenue, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e4135" href="#xd21e4135" name="xd21e4135">183</a>]</span>on
account of its leading to the village of Kennet. The remains on Hakpen
Hill and on Silbury Hill are all supposed to have been originally
connected with those at Avebury. The remains at Hakpen consist of
relics of two circles, one about 140 feet in diameter, the other not
more than forty. About eighty yards from the inner circle was found a
double row of skeletons, all with the feet pointing towards the centre.
Silbury Hill is itself an artificial conical mound, the largest in
England, 170 feet high, on which were originally no less than 650
upright stones, of which only twenty are still standing, surrounded by
a trench. In the centre of the circle of stones a single menhir of
great height still remains with three others sloped so as to form a
kind of crypt.</p>
<p>The megalithic monuments of Stonehenge, which are probably better
known than any others in the world, are perhaps also the most curious.
The group is supposed to have originally consisted of an outer stone
concentric circle some one hundred feet in diameter, formed by thirty
piers of solid masonry, of which about twenty can still be made out,
some few standing, others lying broken upon the ground. This outer
circle enclosed a second of similar shape but lesser diameter, within
which again were taro elliptic circles, the outer consisting of ten or
twelve sandstone blocks some twenty-two feet high, standing in pairs,
each pair united by a slab laid horizontally across, so as to form a
trilithon. The inner ellipse was formed by nineteen upright masses of
granite, within which was the famous slab of blue marble, by many
supposed to have been an altar. The pillars and lintels of the outer
portico, and those of the trilithons, are fitted together with the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4139" href="#xd21e4139" name=
"xd21e4139">184</a>]</span>greatest skill, with tenons and mortices, a
remarkable exception to the general rule with megalithic monuments.
Everywhere in the neighborhood of Stonehenge, as far as the eye can
reach, are tumuli, all nearly equidistant from the principal group of
monuments, a fact which has led many arch&aelig;ologists, including
Henry Martin, to look upon. Stonehenge as a temple surrounded by a
necropolis. Excavations at Stonehenge have yielded a few human bones
which have escaped the flames, with some stone and bronze weapons.</p>
<p>The megalithic monuments of Ireland are not less important, and a
recent survey has reported no less than 276 still standing.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4143src" href="#xd21e4143" name="xd21e4143src">9</a>
The cromlechs of Moytura<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4149src" href=
"#xd21e4149" name="xd21e4149src">10</a> are supposed to commemorate the
fearful combats which took place between the <i>Firbolgs</i>, or
Belg&aelig; as they are called by Irish antiquaries, and the Tuatha de
Dananns, when the plains of Sligo and Meath were dyed with blood,
before the former were vanquished and retired to Arran. There are still
no less than fourteen dolmens and thirty-nine cromlechs. The bones
picked up beneath the stone circles, which keep alive the memory of
these sanguinary conflicts, are those of the warriors who fell on the
battlefield, but the story of how they met their fate belongs rather to
history than to the subject we are considering. It is the same with the
two huge monoliths of Cornwall<span class="corr" id="xd21e4158" title=
"Source: .">,</span> which commemorate a battle between the Welsh King
Howel Dha and the Saxon Athelstane, as well as with the cromlechs of
Ostrogothland, where, in 736, took <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e4161" href="#xd21e4161" name="xd21e4161">185</a>]</span>place the
battle in which the old King Harold Hildebrand was overcome and killed
by his nephew, Sigurd-Ring. A group of forty-four circles also marks
the site of the celebrated combat of 1030, in which Knut the Great
defied Olaf the patron saint of Norway. We may also name in this
connection the twenty circles of stone erected at Upland in memory of
the massacre of the Danish prince, Magnus Henricksson, in 1161. Yet
another group of circles marks the spot where, about 1150, the Swedish
heroine, Blenda, overcame King Sweyne Grate. We might easily multiply
instances of the erection in historic times of similar monuments, but
we have said enough to show that the megalithic form was by no means
confined to prehistoric days.</p>
<p>Menhirs properly so called, also known as <i>lechs</i> in Brittany,
are in reality isolated monoliths or single upright stones, often of
considerable size. One of the best known is that of Locmariaker
(<a href="#fig059">Fig. 59</a>) which was nearly seventy feet
high.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4171src" href="#xd21e4171" name=
"xd21e4171src">11</a> It was still standing in 1659, but is now
overturned and broken into four pieces. The flat stone resting on one
portion of it is known as C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s table. On some menhirs,
notably on Sweno&rsquo;s pillar in Scotland, a cross has been cut on
one side, showing either that this form of monument was early adopted
by Christians, or more probably, that it was adapted to their use after
having long previously been a relic of prehistoric times. On the other
side of Sweno&rsquo;s pillar is a bas-relief of fairly good
execution.</p>
<p>In some cases menhirs mark the site of a tomb, and sometimes, as is
the case with the obelisks of Egypt, they commemorate some happy event.
A standing stone in Scotland preserves the memory of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4179" href="#xd21e4179" name=
"xd21e4179">186</a>]</span>the battle of Largs, which took place in the
thirteenth century, and a piously preserved legend tells how the menhir
of Aberlemmo was set up in honor of a victory over the Danes in the
tenth century.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e4182width" id="fig059"><img src=

<p class="first">The great broken menhir of Locmariaker, with
C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s table.</p>
</div>
<p>Some arch&aelig;ologists in view of the shape of certain menhirs and
the superstitions connected with then, think they must be phallic
monuments. Menhirs in France are quoted in this connection, cut into
the form of the phallus; and the same form occurs in some menhirs near
Saphos, in the island of Cyprus,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4188src"
href="#xd21e4188" name="xd21e4188src">12</a> and in others found
amongst the ruins of Uxmal, in Yucatan. Herodotus relates that
Sesostris caused toy be set up, in countries he conquered, monoliths
bearing in relief representations of the female sexual organs. These
are, however, but exceptions, isolated facts, and it would certainly
never do to argue from them that menhirs were connected with the
worship of the generative flowers of nature.</p>
<p>It is extremely difficult to get at the statistics of menhirs. A
great many have been overthrown, and yet more have disappeared
altogether. Probably, besides the alignments or stone avenues, there
are not more than twenty still standing.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4199src" href="#xd21e4199" name="xd21e4199src">13</a> One thing
is certain, the monolithic form of monument has always had a great
attraction for the human race, and we meet with it in Egypt, Assyria,
Persia, and Mexico, as well as in England and Brittany. The historian
speaks of such monuments in the earliest of existing records; Homer
refers to them in the Iliad,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4205src" href=
"#xd21e4205" name="xd21e4205src">14</a> and in the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4208" href="#xd21e4208" name=
"xd21e4208">188</a>]</span>Bible we find it related that the Lord
ordered Joshua to set up twelve stones in memory of the crossing of the
Jordan by the Israelites.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4210src" href=
"#xd21e4210" name="xd21e4210src">15</a></p>
<p>Alignments are groups of menhirs set up in one or wore rows.
Sometimes large slabs are laid across them, when they arc, called
covered avenues. One such alignment at Saint Pantal&eacute;on
(Sa&ocirc;ne et Loire) consists of twenty menhirs. The menhirs of El
Wad, in Algeria, form long avenues, running front west to east. The
Arabs call them <i>essenam</i>, and according to tradition they were
erected in fulfillment of a vow made in the hope of arresting the march
of an enemy. The tumulus of Run-Aour (Finist&egrave;re) has two avenues
running at right angles to one another.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4221src" href="#xd21e4221" name="xd21e4221src">16</a> This
disposition, which is very rare, also occurs at Karleby, in Sweden, and
by a remarkable coincidence the length of the avenues (about
thirty-nine and fifty-five feet), is the same in both cases. Sometimes
such avenues form communications between several dolmens, leading us to
suppose that near the chief slept the members of his family or his
favorite companions.</p>
<p>The covered avenues are often built beneath masses of earth, and the
inner rooms became regular hypogea, These hypogea, or subterranean
chambers, are very common near Paris, and we may mention amongst many
others those of Meudon, Argenteuil, Conflans-Sainte-Honorine, Marly,
Chamant, La Justice, and Compans. The tombs of Denmark, the <i>Gang
Graben</i> of Nilsson, show an arrangement somewhat similar, a vast
subterranean chamber being reached by a passage ending in a small stone
cist. The tumulus of Dissignac, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e4235" href="#xd21e4235" name="xd21e4235">189</a>]</span>near
Saint-Nazaire (<a href="#fig060">Fig. 60</a>), shows this strange
arrangement of two galleries running parallel with each other at a
distance of about eighteen feet. The walls and ceilings are made of
slab, anti the interstices are filled in with flints. These galleries
are some thirty feet long, and their height insensibly increases from
about three to nine feet.</p>

</div>
<p>We must also mention the Cueva de Mengal, near the village of
Antequera, in the province of Malaga (<a href="#fig061">Fig. 61</a>)
Twenty stones form the walls of the crypt, five blocks of remarkable
size serve as a roof, and to ensure solidity three pillars are set
upright inside of the junction of the roof blocks. The crypt is some
seventy-nine feet long, its greatest width is about nineteen feet, and
its height varies from about eight to nine feet. The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4250" href="#xd21e4250" name=
"xd21e4250">190</a>]</span>length of the Pastora room, near Seville is
about eighty-seven feet, but its height is not to be compared with that
of the one at Antequera. The square crypt at Pastora is very
interesting. One of the roof stones having been broken, it has been
strengthened by the addition of an inside pillar.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4252src" href="#xd21e4252" name="xd21e4252src">17</a></p>

<p class="first">Covered avenue near Antequera.</p>
</div>
<p>At Gavr&rsquo;innis, the length of the passage leading to the crypt
exceeds forty-two feet (<a href="#fig062">Fig. 62</a>), and the Long
Barrow of West Kennet is more than seventy-three feet long by a width
in some parts exceeding thirty-two feet. In the Long Barrows of
Littleton, Nempnitt, and Uley, the crypt is reached by an avenue, the
entrance of which is closed by a trilithon, and a similar arrangement
is met with in many megalithic monuments of Scania. The sepulchral
chambers of oval shape, such as that met with in the island of Moen,
were surmounted by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4268" href=
"#xd21e4268" name="xd21e4268">191</a>]</span>a tumulus some 100 yds. in
circumference; twelve unhewn stones formed the walls, and five large
blocks the roof. In removing the earth from the Moen tomb, the bones of
several human individuals were found; and a skeleton, doubtless that of
the chief, lay stretched out in the middle of the chamber, whilst the
bones of the others had evidently been ranged against the walls either
in a sitting or crouching position. With the bones were found a flint
hatchet, which appeared never to have been used, a number of balls of
amber, and several vases of different shapes.</p>

<p>The megalithic monuments of Mecklenburg are supposed to date from
Neolithic times, and are constructed in two very different ways. The
<i>H&uuml;nengr&auml;ber</i>, formed of huge blocks of granite set up
at right angles to each other, resemble the covered avenues of France
and elsewhere; in the so-called <i>Riesenbetten</i>, or giant&rsquo;s
beds, on the contrary, the sepulchral chamber is merely sunk in the
ground.</p>
<p>We must also mention the so-called <i lang="fr">Grotte des
F&eacute;es</i>, or fairy grotto, forming part of so many of the
megalithic monuments of Provence. This fairy grotto includes an
open-air gallery cut in the mountain limestone and roofed in with huge
flat stones. This <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4289" href=
"#xd21e4289" name="xd21e4289">192</a>]</span>gallery leads to a
sepulchral chamber not less than seventy-nine feet long.</p>
<p>The stones used for the covered avenue of Mureaux (Seine et Oise)
carne from the other side of the Seine, so that the builders must have
crossed the river in a raft. Excavations have brought to light several
skeletons that had been buried without any attempt at orientation, the
bores of which were still in their natural position. The objects found
in this tomb were very numerous mid belonged to the Neolithic
period.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4293src" href="#xd21e4293" name=
"xd21e4293src">18</a></p>
<p>We have now specified the chief forms and modes of arrangement of
megalithic monuments, and must add that they are often found in
juxtaposition. At Man&eacute;-Lud, for instance, on a rocky platform
which had been artificially smoothed, and which is some 246 feet long
by 162 in area, we find at the eastern extremity an avenue of upright
stones, on the west a dolmen, and in the centre a crypt surmounted by a
conical pile of stones. Between the cone and the avenue the ground is
covered with an artificial paving of small stones cemented together,
and known in France as a <i lang="fr">nappe pierreuse</i>, and amongst
the stones forming this paving were found quantities of charcoal and
bones of animals. The megalith was completely buried beneath a mound of
earth, or rather of dried mud, the amount of which was estimated at
more than 37,986 cubic feet. At Lestridiou (Finist&egrave;re), a
cromlech forms the starting-point of an alignment formed of seven rows
of small menhirs, the mean height of which above the ground does not
exceed three feet; and these alignments lead up to two covered avenues
and a central dolmen. In other cases, in England and the land of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4304" href="#xd21e4304" name=
"xd21e4304">193</a>]</span>Moab for instance, alignments simply lead to
cromlechs; whilst in some few cases, as at Stennis (<a href=
"#fig063">Fig. 63</a>), the menhirs are scattered about a plain in
great numbers, with nothing either in their form or their position, or
in the traditions relating to them, to throw the slightest light on
their origin.</p>

"images/fig063.jpg" alt="" width="299" height="290">
<p class="first">Monoliths at Stennis, in the Orkney, Islands.</p>
</div>
<p>One of the most important monuments that have come down to us is
that of Carnac. The alignments of Menec, Kermario, and Kerlescant
include 1,771 menhirs, of which 675 are still standing. The alignments
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4316" href="#xd21e4316" name=
"xd21e4316">194</a>]</span>of Erdeven, which succeed those of Carnac,
extend for a length of more than a mile and a half. They originally
included 1,030 menhirs, of which 288 are still extant.</p>
<p>The arch&aelig;ologists of Brittany, carried away perhaps by their
patriotic enthusiasm, claim that when these monuments were intact they
included two thousand menhirs. What is really certain, however, is that
a definite plan was evidently followed, the distances between the
alignments tallying exactly; the menhirs being set up in straight
parallel lines gradually decreasing in size towards the east.
Excavations near them have brought to light fragments of charcoal,
masses of cinders, chips of silicate of flint, with numerous fragments
of pottery, and tools made of quartzite, granite, schist, and diorite,
similar to those met with under all the other megaliths of Morbihan.
This is yet another proof, if such were needed, that they were all the
work of the same race and all probably date from the same period.</p>
<p>The number of megalithic monuments in the world is simply
incalculable. M. A. Bertrand estimates the total number in France as
2,582, distributed in 66 departments and 1,200 communes. They are most
numerous of all in Brittany; there are 491 in the C&ocirc;tes-du-Nord,
530 in Ille-et-Vilaine. I am not sure of the number in Morbihan, but I
know it is very considerable. The commission appointed at the
instigation of Henry Martin decided that there were as many as 6,310
megaliths in France, but then amongst these were included polishing
stones and cup-shaped stones, with other similar relics of the remote
past. Lastly, a report recently presented to the Chamber of Deputies
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4322" href="#xd21e4322" name=
"xd21e4322">195</a>]</span>by M. A. Proust estimates at 419 the number
of groups classed by government. In other countries these numbers are
greatly exceeded. There are 2,000 megaliths in the Orkney Islands and a
great many in the extreme north of Scania, and in Otranto in the
southern extremity of Europe, where they resemble the <i>pedras
fittas</i> of Sardinia. Pallas, and after him, Haxthausen, tells us
that there are thousands of kurganes in the steppes of Central and
Southern Russia.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4327src" href="#xd21e4327"
name="xd21e4327src">19</a> These kurganes are cromlechs, tombs
surmounted by upright stones, square or conical hypogea, all scattered
about without any apparent system, surmounted by roughly sculptured
female busts, known amongst the common people as <i>kamena baba</i>, or
stone women. Tumuli, too, abound on the shores of the Irtisch and of
the Yenisei, mute witnesses to the former presence of a vanished race
of which we know neither the ancestors nor the descendants. These
monuments are, however, by some attributed to the Tchoudes, a people
who came from the Altai Mountains. The Esthonians, the Ogris or Ulgres,
the Finns, and perhaps even the Celts, are supposed to be branches of
the same ethnological tree. This is however quite a recent idea, and at
best but a mere hypothesis.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4347src" href=
"#xd21e4347" name="xd21e4347src">20</a></p>
<p>Algeria presents a vast field for research, and it is easy to find
dolmens and cromlechs, such as that shown in <a href="#fig064">Fig.
64</a>, which are sepulchres with a central dolmen surrounded by a
double or triple enceinte of monoliths <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e4361" href="#xd21e4361" name="xd21e4361">196</a>]</span>driven
into the ground. These monuments, much as they differ in form and
arrangement, are undoubtedly the work of one strong and powerful race
that dominated the whole of the north of Africa; and are represented in
historic times by the Berbers, and at the present clay by the
Kabyles.</p>

</div>
<p>Although a very great many of them have been destroyed, the French
possessions in Algeria are still as rich in monuments of this kind as
any of the countries of Europe. On Mount Redgel-Safia six hundred
dolmens have been made out, with stone tables <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4370" href="#xd21e4370" name=
"xd21e4370">197</a>]</span>resting on walls of dry stones and
frequently surrounded by cromlechs. Dr. Weisgerber has recently
announced the discovery in the valley of Ain-Massin, on the west of
Mzab, of a cromlech consisting of a number of concentric circles of
large stones set upon an elliptical tumulus, more than fifty-four
square yards in area. Quite close is a workshop of flint weapons,
probably in use at the time of the erection of the megaliths.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4372src" href="#xd21e4372" name=
"xd21e4372src">21</a> In Midjana, the number of megaliths exceeds
10,000, and General Faidherbe counted more than 2,000 in the necropolis
of Mazela, and a yet larger number in that of Roknia. &ldquo;At
Bou-Merzoug,&rdquo; says M. Feraud,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4377src"
href="#xd21e4377" name="xd21e4377src">22</a> &ldquo;in a radius of
three leagues, on the mountain as well as on the plain, the whole
country about the springs is covered with monuments of the Celtic form,
such as dolmens, demi-dolmens, menhirs, avenues, and tumuli. In a word,
there are to be found examples of nearly every type known in Europe.
For fear of being taxed with exaggeration, I will not fix the number,
but I can certify that I saw and examined more than a thousand in the
three days of exploration, on the mountain itself, and on the
declivities wherever it was possible to place them. All the monuments
are surrounded with a more or less complete enceinte of large
stones<span class="corr" id="xd21e4382" title="Source: .">,</span>
sometimes set up in a circle, sometimes in a square<span class="corr"
id="xd21e4385" title="Source: ,">.</span> In some cases the living rock
forms hart of the enceinte, which has been completed with the help of
other blocks frolic elsewhere. It is often difficult to decide where
the monument end, and the rock begins. When the escarpment was too
abrupt, it was levelled with the aid of a kind of retaining wall,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4389" href="#xd21e4389" name=
"xd21e4389">198</a>]</span>which forms a terrace round the dolmen. The
dolmens in the plain seem to have been constructed with even greater
care. The enceintes are wider and the slabs of the tables
larger.&rdquo; Megalithic monuments are met with even in the desert. A
pyramid built of stones without mortar rises up in the districts
inhabited by the Touaregs; and quite near to it are four or five tombs
surrounded by standing stones.</p>
<p>In Algeria, we also meet with quadrangular pyramids called
<i>djedas</i>, which measure as much as ninety feet on each face, but
do not rise more than three feet above the ground. The dead were buried
beneath them in a crouching position. We know nothing either of the
origin of these djedas or of the date to which they belong.</p>
<p>The monuments of Tunisia were probably as numerous as those of
Algeria. We may note especially the vast area in Enfida, completely
covered with dolmens, one hundred of which are still standing, and in
excellent preservation, whilst the ruins of others strew the soil,
bringing up their original number to at least three thousand. Those
described by M. Girard de Rialle<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4399src"
href="#xd21e4399" name="xd21e4399src">23</a> are yet more interesting.
Near the village of Ellez, on the road from Kef to Kerouan, are some
fifteen covered avenues distributed without apparent order, and rising
from the midst of Roman ruins. The upright stones vary from about ten
to thirteen feet, and are surmounted by huge slabs. The chief dolmen
has within it as many as ten chambers.</p>
<p>There are also numerous tumuli in Syria. We have already alluded to
that of Sarepta; and there are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4416"
href="#xd21e4416" name="xd21e4416">199</a>]</span>others near Antioch
and in the plain of Beka, between Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon. Major
Conder, who as captain conducted the interesting campaign organized by
the Palestine Exploration Society in 1881 and 1882, speaks of the
exploration of the rude stone monuments as one of the most interesting
features of the surveys, and says: &ldquo;The distribution of the
centres where these monuments occur in Syria, is a matter of no little
importance &hellip; no dolmens, menhirs, or ancient circles have been
discovered in Jud&aelig;a, and only one doubtful circle in Samaria. In
Lower Galilee a single dolmen has been found; in Upper Galilee four of
moderate dimensions are known. West of Tiberias is a circle, and
between Tyre and Sidon an enclosure of menhirs. At Tell el Kady, one of
the Jordan sources, a centre of basalt dolmens exists, and at Kefr Wal
&hellip; there is another large centre. At Amman several fine dolmens
and large menhirs are known to exist &hellip; it is doubtful, however,
if all these examples added together would equal the great fields of
rude stone monuments to be found in Moab, for it is calculated that
seven hundred examples were found by the surveyors in 1881.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4418src" href="#xd21e4418" name=
"xd21e4418src">24</a> There is one group of dolmens at Ali Safat, in
Palestine, in which the supports of the table are pierced with an
opening. This is a very interesting fact, to which I have already
alluded, and to which I shall have to refer again. Another group of
some twenty dolmens was discovered by M. de Saulcy on the plateau of El
Azemieh, one of which rises in the centre of a belt of roughly
sculptured upright stones; and yet a third group is to be seen near
Mount Nebo, which Major Conder thus describes: &ldquo;Here a
well-defined <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4421" href="#xd21e4421"
name="xd21e4421">200</a>]</span>dolmen was found northwest of the flat,
ruined cairn, which harks the summit of the ride. The cap-stone was
very thick, and its top is some five feet from the ground. The
side-stones were rudely piled, and none of the blocks were cut or
shaped &hellip; In subsequent visits it was ascertained that on the
south slope of the mountain there is a circle about 250 feet in
diameter, with a wall of twelve feet thick, consisting of small stones
piled up in a sort of vellum.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

<p>With regard to the megalithic monuments of India, we can only repeat
what we have already said. Colonel Meadows Taylor has counted 2,129 in
the district of Bellary (Deccan) alone. Many legends are connected with
them which remind us of those of Europe, some attributing their
erection to dwarfs or rants, to fairies or to genii, whilst others
think they were the work of the Kauranas and Pandaves, the celebrated
families whose long struggle is described in the Mahabharata, and were
probably aboriginal races of the continent. The plain of Jellalabad and
of Nagpore, stud the valley of Cabul are literally strewn with these
monuments. They are not less numerous in the Presidency of Madras,
where they chiefly consist of subterranean chambers made of huge unhewn
stones or of dolmens above ground surrounded by one or more circles of
upright stones, such as are shorn in <a href="#fig065">Fig. 65</a>.
Major Biddulph, when he ascended the valleys of the Hindoo Koosh
Mountains, was astonished to see on every side megalithic monuments
resembling those of his own country, and, like them, the work of an
unknown race.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4431src" href="#xd21e4431"

</div>
<p>This is, of course, but a very rapid survey of the megalithic
monuments of our globe. They are most of them either tombs intended to
hold the bodies of the dead, or memorials set up in their honor. New
facts are constantly coming to light in this connection, and we may add
to what we have already said, that beneath the tumulus of Mugen, as in
the Cabeco d&rsquo;Aruda (Portugal), there are numerous skeletons;
sixty-two repose in the sepulchral chamber of Monastier
(Loz&egrave;re); the dolmen known as the Mas de l&rsquo;Aveugle (Gard)
covers a circular cavity in which fifteen corpses had been placed; that
of La Mouline (Charente) also enclosed a number of skeletons, all in a
crouching position, whilst above them were placed two clumsy vases, a
pious offering to the unknown dead. The prehistoric cemetery of Maupas
contains <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4443" href="#xd21e4443"
name="xd21e4443">202</a>]</span>several crypts of irregular form, built
of rubble stone, and surmounted by a huge stone which had become
corroded by age. In these crypts, too, the dead were piled up on each
other, and the relics found with them justify us in assigning them to
the Neolithic age. Beneath the dolmens of Port-Blanc (Morbihan) were
two upper layers of dead, stretched out horizontally and separated by
flat stones. In the Isle de Thinie (Morbihan) excavations have brought
to light twenty-seven stone cists or coffins of different sizes, all
intended to be used for burial. Beneath the menhirs of
Finist&egrave;re, cinders and stones charred by fire bear eloquent
witness to the cremation of the dead. &ldquo;Whenever a dolmen has been
opened in Finist&egrave;re,&rdquo; says Dr. Floquet, &ldquo;cinders or
bones have been picked up; why, then, should we not admit that all
dolmens are tombs?&rdquo; This is really a conclusion to which we are
almost compelled to come, and the names handed down by popular
tradition are, if need be, yet another proof of the same thing. One
dolmen at Locmariaker, for instance, is known as <i lang="fr">le
tombeau du vieillard</i>, a covered avenue at Saint Gildas is <i lang=
"fr">le champ du tombeau</i>, and farther on a pathway leading to a
ruined megalith is known as the <i lang="fr">chemin du tombeau</i>. The
Abb&eacute; Harvard speaks of a remarkable monolith known as <i lang=
"fr">la pierre du champ dolent</i>, and another <i lang="fr">champ
dolent</i> is met with near Rheims, whilst a group of monuments near
Tr&eacute;hontereuc is called the <i lang="fr">jardin des tombes</i>,
and the upright stones of Auvergne are known by the characteristic name
of the <i lang="fr">plourouses</i>.</p>
<p>Whether we examine the megaliths of Germany or of Poland, the mounds
of Ohio or of Kentucky, of Missouri or of Arkansas, it is ever the same
thing; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4469" href="#xd21e4469" name=
"xd21e4469">203</a>]</span>excavations bring to light striking proofs
of their destination, and everywhere we are led to the same
conclusions.</p>
<p>Arch&aelig;ologists would certainly appear to have been justified in
hoping that the tombs thus scattered about all over the world would
yield such useful information as to lead to some final conclusions.
Unfortunately, however, this has not been the case. Often all trace of
burial has disappeared in successive displacements, and more often
still, the home of the dead has been violated in the hope, which turned
out to be imaginary, of finding treasures; whilst in other cases the
earliest inhabitants of the tombs have been removed to make way for
their successors, who in their turn were soon afterwards expelled.
Victory and defeat were not over with life, but were met with yet again
in the grave.</p>

</div>
<p>It has been well pointed out by Fergusson, in his &ldquo;Rude Stone
Monuments,&rdquo; that the megalithic architecture of the remote past
is a thing altogether apart; its special form indicating now the
tendencies of a race or group of races of mankind, now the particular
degree of civilization attained by a race at a certain period of its
development. A cursory view of these monuments as a whole would lead us
to class them all together as masses of rough, scarcely hewn stones
piled up without cement, and almost always without ornamentation. In
studying them one by one, however, we find, in spite of their
undeniable family likeness, if we may use such a term, that it is quite
easy to snake out certain differences, the result of the peculiar
genius of the race by whom they were erected, or of the nature of the
materials the builders had at their disposal. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4480" href="#xd21e4480" name=
"xd21e4480">204</a>]</span>To take a case in point: Cromlechs are most
numerous in England, and dolmens in France, and in both these countries
we meet with a form of dolmen (<a href="#fig066">Fig. 66</a>) such as
is rarely set up in other districts; one of the extremities of the
table resting on the ground, and the other opt two supporting stones.
In Scandinavia the supports are erratic blocks, in India fragments of
the rocks in the neighborhood, in Algeria and the south of France
buildings in courses are often met with; in Brittany the monuments of
Man&eacute;-er-H&rsquo;roek and Man&eacute;-Lud are paved with large
stones. The ground from which rises the dolmen of Caranda, near
F&egrave;re in Tardenois (Aisne), is covered with slabs, and the
opening is closed with a flat stone resting on two lintels. We cannot
speak of Caranda without referring to the discoveries and magnificent
publications of M. F. Moreau, thanks to whom the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4485" href="#xd21e4485" name=
"xd21e4485">205</a>]</span>daily life of the Gauls, Gallo-Romans, and
Merovingians is brought vividly before us. To return, however to our
monuments: As we have seen, the crypt was in many cases divided into
two or more sepulchral chambers by walls made of stones. We find this
arrangement at Gavr&rsquo;innis, at Gamat (Lot), at Alt-Sammit in
Mecklenburg, in Wayland Smith&rsquo;s cave in Berkshire, and in a great
many monuments in Scandinavia. M. du Chatellier speaks of several
megalithic monuments in Finist&egrave;re, including a central dolmen
and several lateral chambers. The chambered graves at Park Cwn in
Wales, and at Uley in Gloucestershire, contain side chambers, those of
the former with a covered passage between them, whilst in the latter
the side chambers are grouped round a central apartment. At New Grange,
in Ireland, a passage more than ninety-two feet long leads to a double
chamber of cruciform shape, with a roof of converging stones. Yet
another fine example of a similar kind is that of Maeshow in the Orkney
Islands. The tomb of Vaur&eacute;al (Seine-et-Oise) contains three
crypts of different sizes. The long barrow of Moustoir-Carnac contained
four separate chambers, the western one of which is a dolmen of the
kind known as <i>Grottes des F&eacute;es</i>, and is supposed to be
much older than the rest of the group. A central circular chamber, with
walls of upright stones, has a roof in which an attempt has been made
to form a kind of dome, the stones of which project and overlap each
other, marking, clumsy as is the construction, a considerable advance
on anything previously accomplished, and adding considerably to the
solidity of the monument.</p>
<p>An examination of the megalithic monuments still <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4492" href="#xd21e4492" name=
"xd21e4492">206</a>]</span>standing enables us to judge of the
difficulties with which their builders had to contend, bearing in mind
the primitive nature of their tools. We have already given the
dimensions of the stones forming the alignments at Carnac. Those at
Avebury vary in height from about fourteen to sixteen feet, and in the
Deccan is a tumulus surrounded by fifty-six blocks of granite of an
even greater size. One of the slabs of the Pedra-dos-Muros (Portugal)
is remarkable for its size; and the length of the table of a dolmen on
the road from Loudun to Fontevrault is more than seventy-two feet long;
that of the dolmen of Tiaret (Algeria) is some seventy-five feet long
by a width of nearly twenty-six feet and a thickness of nine and a half
feet. This extremely heavy block rests on supports rising more than
thirty-nine feet from the ground.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4494src"
href="#xd21e4494" name="xd21e4494src">27</a></p>
<p>Stone as well as wood can be much more easily cut in one direction
than in any other. Men early learnt to recognize this peculiarity, and
to take advantage of it in attacking rock. With their stone hammers
they struck in straight lines, always aiming at the same points, and
then, probably with the help of a fierce file, they succeeded in
breaking off fragments. They also employed wedges of wood, which they
drove into natural or artificial fissures, pouring water on to this
wedge again and again. The wood became swollen with the damp, and in
course of time a block of stone would be detached. Neither time nor
sinewy arms were wanting, and Fergusson has remarked that any one who
has seen the ease with which Chinese coolies <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4502" href="#xd21e4502" name=
"xd21e4502">207</a>]</span>transport the largest monoliths for
considerable distances, will not look upon the difficulties of
transport as insurmountable. A more serious difficulty would be the
placing of the table of the dolmen on the supports, which are often
raised to a great height above the ground. It is supposed that earth
was piled up against the jambs so as to form an inclined plane, up
which the table was slid into place with levers and rollers of the most
primitive form, such as were in use in the most remote antiquity.
Sometimes the way in which these stones are balanced is perfectly
marvellous. The Martine stone, near Livernon (Lot), for instance, is
the shape of a boat, and the slightest touch is enough to make it rock
on its two supports. That of Castle Wellan (<a href="#fig055">Fig.
55</a>) rests on three stones pointed at the top, and some of the
trilithons of India are of even more remarkable construction.</p>
<p>Although, as a general rule, megalithic monuments are without
ornamentation, there are a good many exceptions in the case of dolmens
made of very hard granite, on which numerous carvings and engravings
have been made. It is, however, impossible to decipher any but a very
few of these signs, whether circles, disks, dots, tooth or leaf
mouldings, spirals, serpentine lines, lozenges, or strip.</p>
<p>M. du Chatellier describes at Commana (Finist&egrave;re) an entrance
gallery loaded with carvings, and the walls of one of the
Deux-S&egrave;vres monuments have on them some very rough
representations of the human figure cut in <i>intaglio</i>, whilst
various megaliths of Ireland are adorned with circles, spirals, stars,
etc. One of the supports of the dolmen of Petit-Mont-en-Arzon has on it
a representation of two human feet in relief; that of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4514" href="#xd21e4514" name=
"xd21e4514">208</a>]</span>Couedic in Lockmikel-Baden is paired with
flat stones covered with engravings. On the granite ceiling of the
crypt beneath the dolmen of the Merchants, or as it is called in
Brittany the <i>Dol Varchant</i>, is engraved the figure of a large
animal supposed to have been a horse, but the head of which was
unfortunately broken off at some remote date.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4519src" href="#xd21e4519" name="xd21e4519src">28</a> We often
meet with representations of hammers, sometimes with and sometimes
without handle. We give an illustration of one of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4528" href="#xd21e4528" name=
"xd21e4528">209</a>]</span>the walls of the Man&eacute;-Lud monument
(<a href="#fig067">Fig. 67</a>), which will enable the reader to judge
of the general character of these engravings.</p>

</div>
<p>The monument of the Isle of Gavr&rsquo;innis, of which we have
already spoken, is the most remarkable of any for the richness of its
decoration. It includes a gallery, consisting of forty-nine blocks of
granite and two of quartz, leading to a spacious apartment. These
blocks were brought from a distance, and the fact that the little arm
of the sea separating the island from the mainland was crossed, proves
that the men who built the monument owned boats strong enough to carry
heavy loads. Excavations carried on in 1884 brought to light a pavement
consisting of ten large slabs of granite, and beneath this pavement was
found a kind of crypt at least three feet deep, the lower part of the
lateral menhirs forming the walls. We must add, however, that Dr. de
Closmadeuc, and his opinion should carry weight, thinks that when the
Gavr&rsquo;innis monument was erected the island was connected with the
mainland. Three of the supports, forming the walls of the crypt, and
all those of the gallery are covered with chevrons or zig-zag
ornaments, circles, lozenges, and scrolls of which <a href=
"#fig068">Fig. 68</a> will give some idea, and which
M&eacute;rim&eacute;e compares to the tatooing of the inhabitants of
New Zealand. Megalithic monuments of Ireland and certain stones in
Northumberland are ornamented in a manner resembling the
Gavr&rsquo;innis engraving, similar designs being produced by similar
means, and although the engravings of Morbihan are generally more
clearly cut and distinct, Ave note in all alike the same absence of
regularity, the same roughness of execution, the same strange types,
the same <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4544" href="#xd21e4544"
name="xd21e4544">210</a>]</span>disorder in the arrangement of the
signs, and the same care to preserve the surface of the block in its
natural condition.</p>

<p>There has been a good deal of discussion about the orientation of
megalithic monuments, and the truth on that point once ascertained,
some light might be thrown on the aim of the builders. It is evident,
however, that there never was any general system of orientation. The
dolmens of Morbihan, it is true, nearly all face the east, doubtless in
homage to the sun rising in its splendor; but this is not the case in
Finist&egrave;re, and the dolmens of Kervinion and Kervardel, for
instance, are set due north and south. Leaving Brittany, we are told by
the Rev. W. Lukis that the position of the megalithic monuments of
England varies considerably: most of the dolmens of Berry, Poitou,
Aveyron, and the island of Bornholm, face <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e4553" href="#xd21e4553" name="xd21e4553">211</a>]</span>west; and
those of Algeria are set southwest, and northeast, so that it is really
impossible to come to any final conclusion.</p>
<p>Some of the megalithic monuments already noticed have a peculiarity
to which we must refer here on account of its importance. One of the
supports, in nearly every case that which closes the entrance, is
pierced with a circular opening. Sometimes, however, the opening is
elliptical or square.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e4558width" id="fig069"><img src=
"images/fig069.jpg" alt="" width="259" height="153">
<p class="first">Dolmen with opening (India).</p>
</div>
<p>We meet with dolmens thus distinguished in India (<a href=
"#fig069">Fig. 69</a>), in Sweden, in Algeria, in France, and in
Palestine, where they are often associated with sepulchral niches hewn
out of the rock and also pierced with an opening corresponding with
that of the entrance. In Alemtejo (Spain), square openings occur. West
of Karleby in Sweden, is a sepulchral chamber about twenty-nine feet
long, made of slabs set upright, all those facing south being pierced
with a nearly circular opening; and on the shores of the Black Sea
dolmens made of four upright stones surmounted by a slab, have,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4567" href="#xd21e4567" name=
"xd21e4567">212</a>]</span>in every case, one of the uprights pierced
with an artificial opening about six inches in diameter. These dolmens
are said by the country people to have been set up by a race of giants
who built them as shelters for a dwarf people on whom they had
compassion.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e4570width" id="fig070"><img src=
"images/fig070.jpg" alt="" width="305" height="217">
<p class="first">Dolmen near Trie (Oise).</p>
</div>
<p>In France, dolmens with openings are so numerous that it is
difficult to make a selection. That known as La Justice, near
Beaumont-sur-Oise, consists of a small vestibule and a very long
mortuary chamber, separated by a slab pierced with a round opening. We
must also mention the megalithic monument of
Villers-Saint-S&eacute;pulchre at Trie (Oise) (<a href="#fig070">Fig.
70</a>), that of Grand-Mont, with many of those of Morbihan, of which
that of Kerlescant has an oval opening; the covered avenue of
Conflans-Sainte-Honorine, originally erected at the confluence of the
Seine and Oise, and now set up <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4580"
href="#xd21e4580" name="xd21e4580">213</a>]</span>exactly as it was
found at Saint Germain, has an oval opening, and presents the
exceptional feature, of which I know no other instance, of having a
stone for closing the opening if necessary; the covered avenue of
Bellehaye in Normandy, reproduced with precision at the Paris
Exhibition of 1889, which was closed by a transverse stone with an
opening some inches in diameter.</p>
<p>Of English examples we may mention the dolmens of Rodmarten and
Avening; <span class="corr" id="xd21e4584" title=
"Source: Merim&eacute;e">M&eacute;rim&eacute;e</span> quotes several
megalithic monuments in Wiltshire; and Sir J. Simpson, the well-known
and oft-described <i>Kit&rsquo;s Cotty House</i>, which is nothing more
than a dolmen with an opening. <i>Holed Stones</i>, as they are called,
are numerous in Cornwall, the size of the opening varying considerably;
that at Men-an-Tol, for instance, is more than a foot in diameter,
whilst others are but a few inches long. At Orry&rsquo;s Grave, in the
Isle of Man, two large stones are so placed as to leave a circular
space between them, which was evidently intended to serve the same
purpose, or at least was in accordance with the same superstition, as
were similar characteristics elsewhere. Setting aside the interminable
legends connected with dolmens having openings, there is no doubt that
this peculiarity of structure, which we meet with in India as in
Scandinavia, in the Caucasus as in France, shows that the builders of
all of them were impelled by a similar idea. These openings are too
small to allow of the introduction of other corpses, or to afford to
the living a refuge in the home of the dead; they could but have served
for the passing in of food, of which a supply was so often left for the
departed; or yet another interpretation is possible: they may have been
left for the soul or the spirit to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e4593" href="#xd21e4593" name="xd21e4593">214</a>]</span>leave its
earthly prison and take flight for those happy regions in which all
races more or less believe, and to which belief these openings may be
witnessed to the present day. M. Cartailhac, however, hazards yet
another explanation, and suggests that the megalithic monuments were
intended for the interment of whole families, and that the bodies were
not introduced into the tombs until all the flesh was gone, when the
skeletons might have been slipped through the openings left for that
purpose. The repeated disturbances of the remains in the graves have
unfortunately often entirely dispersed all the human bones.</p>
<p>It was in Brittany that the art of erecting dolmens reached its
fullest development, and it is there that the relics found in the tombs
are of the most important character. Nowhere do we find weapons more
carefully preserved, more delicately finished ornaments of a more
remarkable kind. The Museum of Vannes, where most of the valuable
objects found in the excavations are preserved, possesses quartzite,
fibrolite, diorite, and even nephrite and jadeite hatchets, some of
which materials are not native to Europe; as well as amber beads and a
necklace of cala&iuml;te, that precious stone described by Pliny, and
which long remained unknown after his time.</p>
<p>Hatchets or celts are more numerous than any other objects found
beneath dolmens of Brittany. A report, read by M. R. Galles to the
Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Polymathique of Morbihan, enumerates the objects
found with the dead beneath the dolmen of Saint-Michel. This report is
a regular inventory, in which figure eleven jade celts of great
elegance of form and varying from about three and a half to sixteen
inches, two larger celts of coarse <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e4599" href="#xd21e4599" name=
"xd21e4599">215</a>]</span>workmanship both broken, twenty-six small
fibrolite celts with sharp edges, nine pendants, more than one hundred
jasper beads which had been part of a necklace, and lastly an ivory
ring. Other megalithic monuments were not less rich in relics. Thirty
hatchets were picked up at Tumiac; more than a hundred, nearly all of
tremolite, at Man&eacute;-er-H&rsquo;roek; which were remarkable for
their regularity of form, their polish, and the variety of their
colors. They seldom bear any traces of having been used, and in many
cases they appear to have been intentionally broken, probably in
conformity with some funereal rite. Finist&egrave;re, though not so
rich as Morbihan, furnished an important contingent. The excavations of
the Kerhu&eacute;-Bras tumulus brought to light a sepulchral chamber
which contained thirty-three arrow-beads. Beneath other dolmens were
picked up a number of little plaques of slate, all pierced with holes;
one of these pieces of slate, which was oblong in form, bore on it a
representation of a sun with rays surrounded by ornaments not easy to
make out. The Breton megalithic monuments also contained numerous
fragments of pottery, some of which had formed part of vases without
stands, such as those found at Santorin and at Troy.</p>
<p>In other parts of France, similar discoveries have been made; shells
often brought from distant shores, glass beads, amber bowls, hatchets
and celts made of stone foreign to the country. Dr. Pruni&egrave;res
presented to the French Association, when it met at Bordeaux, a
collection of weapons and ornaments which came from the megalithic
monuments of Loz&egrave;re. M. Cartailhac described at the Prehistoric
Congress of Copenhagen the dolmen of Grailhe (Gard). A skeleton
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4603" href="#xd21e4603" name=
"xd21e4603">216</a>]</span>was found beneath it crouching in a corner;
whilst round about it lay a knife, a flint arrow-head, a vase of coarse
pottery, and in the earth forming the tumulus were picked up twenty
arrow-heads, a hatchet of chloromelanite, with numerous beads and
fragments of pottery. Were these offerings to the dead, or to the
infernal deities, given to them in the hope of propitiating them in
favor of the deceased? Beneath the megalith of Saint Jean d&rsquo;Alcas
were found beads of blue glass and of enamel which Dr.
Pruni&egrave;res, having compared with those in the Campana collection
in the Louvre, thinks are of Ph&oelig;nician origin. The tumuli of the
Pyrenees have yielded cala&iuml;te beads of the shape of small
cylinders pierced with holes; and the dolmen of Breton
(Tarn-et-Garonne) eight hundred and thirty-two necklace beads, some of
the shape of a heart. Beneath the Vaur&eacute;al dolmen were found five
skulls in a row, and near one of them, that of a woman, lay a necklace
made of round bits of bone and slate, on which hung a little jadeite
hatchet as an amulet. These human relics were also accompanied by a
fibrolite celt, numerous little worked flints, and some fragments of
pottery. This arrangement of skulls in a tomb is very rare, and the
only thing I can compare it to is the row of five horses&rsquo; heads
placed at the end of the entrance gallery of Man&eacute;-Lud.</p>
<p>At Alt-Sammit (Mecklenburg), were round stone hatchets, flint
knives, fragments of pottery covered with strive and ornaments; at
Tenarlo (Holland), urns and amber beads. At Ancress in the island of
Jersey, we find a regular necropolis dating from Neolithic times, and
one hundred vases or urns of different forms were collected. In the
Long Barrow of West Kennet, too, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e4607" href="#xd21e4607" name="xd21e4607">217</a>]</span>were
found numerous fragments of pottery, and with these fragments
boars&rsquo; tusks longer than those of the boar of the present clay,
the bones of sheep, goats, roedeer, pigs, and of a large species of ox,
all of which are probably relics of a funeral feast. At a little
distance from West Kennet the Rev. Doyen Merewether found several flint
implements. Here too, then, as elsewhere, the home of the living was
side by side with the resting-place of the dead.</p>
<p>Beneath the dolmens of West Gothland have been found polished stone
weapons and tools associated with the bones of domestic animals, in
many cases bearing traces of the work of the hand of man. At Olleria,
in the kingdom of Valencia, at Xeres de la Frontera, we find diorite
hatchets, and in Algeria vases filled with the shells of land mollusca.
In every clime we meet with tokens of the respect in which the dead
were held.</p>
<p>This respect is really very remarkable. The builders of the dolmens
did not hesitate to sacrifice their most precious objects, their
richest ornaments, their hatchets and precious stones brought from a
distance by their tribe in their long migrations. No one would dream of
robbing the sacred collection. Our own contemporaries, however
civilized we may flatter ourselves by considering them, would not prove
themselves as disinterested.</p>
<p>Hatchets, pottery, and personal ornaments of stone bone, etc., are
not the only artificial objects found beneath the megalithic monuments.
Metals, too, have been discovered, and M. Piette in one of his
excavations, came across a plate formed of very thin layers of gold
leaf welded together by hammering; and in several parts of the south of
France have been found olives made of gold and pierced lengthwise. The
dolmen of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4615" href="#xd21e4615"
name="xd21e4615">218</a>]</span>Carnouet in Brittany, insignificant as
it appears and containing but one small sepulchral chamber with no
gallery of access or lateral crypts, beneath a tumulus about thirteen
feet high by some eighty-five in diameter, and which was left untouched
until our own day, actually contained a golden necklace weighing over
seven ounces; in the crypt of the Castellet monument was found a golden
plaque and a golden bead; whilst the Ors dolmen in the isle of Oleron
concealed a nugget which had been rolled into the shape of a bead
probably after having been beaten thin with a hammer. At Plouharnel,
two golden amulets were found beneath a triple dolmen, and M. du
Chatellier, in excavating beneath a megalithic monument in
Finist&egrave;re, found a magnificent chain of gold. A somewhat similar
chain was taken from the Leys dolmen near Inverness, and in 1842 Lord
Albert Cunningham picked up at New Grange (Ireland) two necklaces, a
brooch, and a ring, all of gold.</p>
<p>More than a hundred megalithic monuments of France have been found
to contain bronze, and this number would be more than doubled if we
counted the finds in tombs not connected with megaliths, such as those
of Aveyron and Loz&egrave;re, where a few bits of bronze were found
mixed with numerous stone objects. One fifth of the weapons, especially
the swords and daggers found beneath the dolmens, are of bronze. At
Kerhu&eacute; in Finist&egrave;re, a number of bronze swords were
arranged in a circle round a little heap of cinders and black earth,
relics, probably, of the cremation of the dead, in honor of whom the
tumulus had been erected.</p>
<p>Beneath the dolmens of Roknia (Algeria) were found thirteen bronze
ornaments, and two in silver gilt of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e4621" href="#xd21e4621" name="xd21e4621">219</a>]</span>very
superior workmanship, and under those of the Caucasus were picked up
blue-glass beads, arrow-heads, and bronze rings; but M. Chantre, who is
an authority in the matter, thinks these objects date from interments
subsequent to the erection of the dolmens.</p>
<p>Iron was much more rarely used than bronze in the greater part of
Europe. It was not even known in Scandinavia before the Christian era.
In Germany, Pannonia, and Noricum its use dates from the sixth or
seventh century B.C. Beneath the mounds of Central America we find but
a few fragments of meteoric iron, the rarity of which made them
extremely valuable; on the other hand iron was known to the Hellenes as
long ago as the fourteenth century B.C., and it had been employed in
Egypt for many centuries prior to that time. The most ancient
sepulchres of Malabar contain iron tridents, and Genesius dates their
use from before the deluge. It is therefore surprising to find that
some races remained for an illimitable time ignorant of the way to
procure a metal of such great utility.</p>
<p>Iron was not used in Brittany until towards the close of the period
during which megalithic monuments were erected. Stone, bronze, and iron
were found together in the Nignol tomb at Carnac, which dates from the
time when cremation was already practised. We find the same association
of different materials in the Rocher dolmen.</p>
<p>In the British Isles, especially in Scotland and in Ireland, bronze
and iron objects are more numerous than in France. At Aspatria, near
St. Bees in Cumberland, a cist was discovered containing the skeleton
of a man measuring seven feet from the crown of the head to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4630" href="#xd21e4630" name=
"xd21e4630">220</a>]</span>the feet. Near the giant lay numerous
valuable objects, including an iron sword inlaid with silver, a gold
buckle, the fragments of a shield and of a battle-axe, and the iron bit
of a snaffle bridle. The great cairn of Dowth, in Ireland, contained
iron knives and rings mixed with bone needles, copper pins, and glass
and amber beads, all showing rapid progress in the industrial arts. The
remarkable cairns near Lough Crew (Ireland), which were untouched and
indeed unknown to arch&aelig;ologists until 1863, were found to
contain, amongst many other interesting objects, numerous human bones,
fragments of pottery, shells of marine mollusca, 4,884 bone implements,
and seven pieces of iron very much oxidized. The tumuli of the Grand
Duchy of Posen and those of Prussia cover kistvaens containing funeral
vases, weapons, and silver and gold ornaments.</p>
<p>We are altogether in the dark as to the date or the use of the
various objects found in these tombs, and the coins bearing dates which
are often associated with them, do not seem to help us much, belonging
as they doubtless do to a much later period than the erection of the
monuments. We may, however, mention that near the surface of the mound
of Man&eacute;-er-H&rsquo;roek eleven medals of Roman emperors from
Tiberius to Trajan were found; whilst under the tumulus of Rosmeur, on
the Penmarch Point (Finist&egrave;re), were various Roman coins; at
Bergous in <span class="corr" id="xd21e4634" title=
"Source: Lockmariaker">Locmariaker</span>, at Man&eacute;-Rutual, and
at other places in Brittany, coins of the earliest Christian emperors;
at Uley, in Gloucestershire, some coins of the time of the sons of
Constantine; at Mining-Low (Derbyshire), beneath a kistvaen surrounded
by a cromlech, some medals of Valentinianus; at Galley-Low,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4637" href="#xd21e4637" name=
"xd21e4637">221</a>]</span>with a magnificent gold necklace set with
garnets, a coin of Honorius, but as these last were found at the outer
edge of the mound there are doubts as to the time of their deposition;
these doubts were, however, to some extent set at rest by the finding
of a coin of Geta beneath the monument itself. We might multiply
instances of similar finds, but I will only mention one more, the
discovery under some Scotch barrows of silver necklaces and coins of
the Caliphs of Bagdad, bearing date from 88 887 to 945 A.D.</p>
<p>This last discovery confirms what I have already said, that the
introduction of the coins was of much later date than the erection of
the monument. Another fact adds weight to this decision. The most
ancient Gallic coins date from about three centuries before our era,
and the earliest British from a century earlier than that. How is it
that excavations have brought to light no specimens of either? The
Romans successively occupied all the countries of which we have just
spoken; the tombs themselves bear witness to their conquests; and it is
to the violation of the tombs, the displacements, and secondary
interments that we owe the introduction of coins, pottery, and bricks
that undoubtedly date from the Roman period, and were probably placed
beside their dead by the Roman legionaries.</p>
<p>Whatever may be the difficulties, however, we are already able to
come to certain definite conclusions. We cannot connect the megalithic
monuments with any one of the ancient religions known. They were
certainly not set up in honor of Odin or of Osiris, of Astarte or of
Athene, the Phoenician or the Egyptian, the Greek or the Roman gods;
their erection seems to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4643" href=
"#xd21e4643" name="xd21e4643">222</a>]</span>have had but one end in
view, to do honor to the dead. Beneath none of them do we find the
remains either of the cave-bear or of the reindeer, still less of the
mammoth or of the rhinoceros; whereas we do constantly meet with the
bones of animals characteristic of Neolithic times. It is therefore to
that period that we must attribute the more ancient of these mysterious
monuments. And the setting up of such memorials continued throughout
the intermediate time between the Stone and Bronze ages, and through
the Bronze and Iron periods. It was, indeed, still practised now and
then in the earlier centuries of the Christian era. More than that,
such monuments are even now occasionally erected. The Khassias of India
make cromlechs of large, flat unhewn stones, some six to seven feet
high, and the Angami-Nagas of the extreme north of British India set up
extensive alignments of menhirs, similar to those of France.
Inscriptions in the old Irish cipher writing, known as ogham, prove
that megalithic monuments were erected in Ireland after the time of St.
Patrick; and, as we have already remarked, some of the Breton menhirs
are surrounded by crosses. In India, too, we find the symbol of the
Christian faith, and in 1867, were discovered on the shores of the
Godavery between Hyderabad and Nagpore, a few dolmens made of four
upright stones surmounted by one or two slabs of sandstone, and
encircling a cross which is said to date from the same age as the
dolmens themselves. We must add, however, that the most competent
arch&aelig;ologists are of opinion that this form of the cross was not
introduced into India until about the sixth or seventh century of our
era. Probably the erection of megalithic monuments <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4645" href="#xd21e4645" name=
"xd21e4645">223</a>]</span>was not discontinued in England or in France
until towards the eighth or ninth century after Christ; and the menhirs
set up later in Scotland and in Scandinavia prove how fondly the people
of those countries clung to ancient traditions. These rude stone
monuments were handed down from one race to another, from invaders to
invaded, from conquered to conquerors.</p>
<p>We must not, however, omit to mention one serious objection. Roman
historians, exact as is their description of Gaul, Britannia, and
Germania, are silent as to stone monuments. Tacitus does not refer to
Stonehenge or to Avebury. C&aelig;sar was present at the naval battle
between his own fleet and that of the Veneti, in the Gulf of Morbihan,
and if the megalithic monuments of Carnac were then there, would they
not have arrested the attention of the great captain? This silence is
the more inexplicable as one of the earliest geographers mentions the
stone of Iapygia; Ptolemy speaks of a similar stone on the shores of
the ocean; Strabo, of a group of dolmens near Cape Cuneus; Quintus
Curtius, of an important alignment in Bactriana; Pliny, who mentions a
leaning pillar in Asia Minor, says nothing of the megalithic monuments
of Gaul, which he crossed several times. Moreover, Ausonius, Sidonius,
Appollinaris, and Fortunatus, who are so eager to glorify their own
land, maintain a similar silence with regard to these structures.
Sulpicius, Severus, and Gregory of Tours, old chroniclers of French
history, also pass them over without a word. More than that, Madame de
S&eacute;vign&eacute;, who was stopping at Auray in 1689, and visited
its environs, writes to her daughter of all she has seen and done,
without alluding to the alignments of Carnac, or of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4649" href="#xd21e4649" name=
"xd21e4649">224</a>]</span>Erdeven, which were, of course, much more
complete in her day than in ours. In fact, they are mentioned for the
first time by Sauvag&egrave;re, in his &ldquo;Recueil des Antiquites de
la Gaule,&rdquo; in which he attributes them to the Romans. We may
therefore, perhaps, conclude that these decayed and clumsy-looking
monuments were despised for generations, no one realizing their
importance or caring to penetrate their secrets.</p>
<p>If need were, we have yet other proofs of their extreme antiquity.
In excavating an alignment in the district occupied by the Kermario
group, a Roman encampment was discovered. The enceinte is represented
by a long wall about six feet thick, and propped up against this wall
were found a number of flat stones blackened with smoke, on which the
legionaries doubtless cooked their food. In some instances these
hearths were made on an overturned menhir, and other menhirs, which had
belonged to the alignment, were fitted into the walls. A Roman road
passes near Avebury, and, contrary to their general custom, the haughty
conquerors had turned aside to avoid the tumulus. These are decisive
proofs that in France and England at least the megalithic monuments
were erected before the advent of the Romans.</p>
<p>Difficult as it is to come to any definite conclusion as to the age
of the monuments, it is yet more difficult to ascertain to what race
their builders belonged. In the first place we ask: Are they all the
work of one race? The contrary, earnestly maintained by M. de
Mortillet, has long been the general opinion. M. Worsaae declared, at
the Brussels Congress,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4655src" href=
"#xd21e4655" name="xd21e4655src">29</a> that the dolmens were erected
by different peoples; M. Cazalis de Fondouce,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4660src" href="#xd21e4660" name="xd21e4660src">30</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4665" href="#xd21e4665" name=
"xd21e4665">225</a>]</span>M. Broca,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4667src" href="#xd21e4667" name="xd21e4667src">31</a> and M.
Cartailhac,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4672src" href="#xd21e4672" name=
"xd21e4672src">32</a> share this belief. &ldquo;Are not the monuments
of huge stones,&rdquo; says M. Fondouce, &ldquo;the product of a
progressive civilization growing by degrees, rather than the work of a
single people maintaining their own manners and customs in the midst of
the old primitive populations they visited, without borrowing anything
from their hosts?&rdquo; To Broca, the resemblance between the dolmens
of Europe, Africa, and even of America proves but one thing: the
similarity of the aspirations and powers of all men. Everywhere, and at
every time, men have aimed, in their monuments, not only at durability,
but at the expression of force and of power. It was with this end in
view that they erected menhirs and selected enormous stones for their
megalithic monuments. The dolmen, which looks like an architectural
building, is but a modification of primitive tombs. The cave-man first
turned to account natural or artificial rock shelters, and when they
were not to be had, he imitated them in such materials as he had at his
disposal. Hence we have crypts, kistvaens, and dolmens; and the
resemblance between them proves nothing as to the parentage of their
builders.</p>
<p>We may add that the distances between what we may call megalithic
zones is considerable. We meet, for instance, with dolmens in Circassia
and in the Crimea, but there are no others nearer than the Baltic.
There are none in the districts peopled by the Belg&aelig;, from the
Drenthe to the borders of Normandy, nor are there any in the valleys of
the Rhine or of the Scheldt. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4679"
href="#xd21e4679" name="xd21e4679">226</a>]</span>There are but a few
in Italy or in Greece, where Pelasgic buildings were early erected, and
bore witness to a more advanced civilization. We meet with them again,
however, in Palestine, but we must traverse many miles before we find
other examples at Peshawur and in the valley of Cabul. It is difficult
to overrate the importance of these facts, or to explain these gaps.
Are they, however, so complete as has been supposed? The few travellers
who have crossed Afghanistan and Daghestan have seen tumuli which may
have served as points of union between the monuments of India and those
of the Caucasus. The megalithic monuments of Palestine and of Arabia
may yet be found to be linked with those of Algeria, by examples in the
little known regions between the Nile and the Regency of Tripoli. If
our ignorance forbids us to assert anything on this point, it equally
forbids our denying anything with any confidence. We may also add one
general remark: the countries where megalithic monuments are found,
abound in granite, in sandstone, and in flint, whilst other districts
have only very friable limestones; and, their monuments, if they were
ever erected, would have been more easily destroyed, the very ruins
disappearing and leaving no trace.</p>
<p>It has been said, moreover, that the mode of construction of the
dolmens, and we hate ourselves made the same remark, is far from being
the same everywhere. The dolmens of Brittany have sepulchral chambers
with long passages leading to them; those of the neighborhood of Paris
have wide covered avenues with a very short entrance lobby. In the
south of France we see nothing but rectangular compartments formed of
four or five colossal stones. All this <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e4683" href="#xd21e4683" name="xd21e4683">227</a>]</span>is true
enough; but if we examine our old cathedrals of comparatively modern
date, the common origin of which is never disputed, we note differences
no less remarkable. On the other hand it is urged that if megalithic
monuments were all erected by one race, the objects they contain would
certainly resemble each other to a great extent. But even this is not
the case. The hatchets so numerous in the west of France are rare in
the south; those from the Algerian monuments are always of coarse
workmanship, whilst those of Denmark are highly finished. We might
multiply instances, but as a matter of fact do we not see the same kind
of thing in the present day, in spite of our railways and other modes
of rapid communication, and the perpetual intermarrying of modern
peoples? Compare the ornaments of Normandy with those of the Basque
provinces, those of Brittany with those of Burgundy, and surely the
differences between them will be found to be as great as we note in the
weapons and ornaments of the builders of the megalithic monuments.</p>
<p>To sum up: according to the opinion of many eminent savants,
numerous races have been in the habit of raising megalithic monuments,
the form of which varies <i>ad infinitum</i> according to the genius or
the circumstances of each race, and according to the nature of the soil
or of the material at the disposal of the builders. All, however,
belong to one general type, and bear witness to one general influence,
which extended throughout the whole world at a certain epoch. M.
Cazalis de Fondouce, from whom I borrow these last observations, would
probably find it as difficult to say how a general influence was
extended <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4691" href="#xd21e4691"
name="xd21e4691">228</a>]</span>to races of which he denies the common
parentage, and the relations and contemporaneity he can but guess at,
as I myself should&mdash;granting the contrary hypothesis&mdash;to
explain how a people could wander about the world in incessant
migrations without modifying its own habits or communicating to others
its rites and its mode of erecting monuments.</p>
<p>We cannot, however, fail to recognize the evidence of facts. We can
understand how men were everywhere impelled to raise mounds above the
bodies of their ancestors, to perpetuate their memory or to enclose
their mortal remains between flat stones to save them from being
crushed by the weight of earth above them. We may even, by straining a
point, admit the idea that a large cist developed into a dolmen, but
when in districts separated by enormous distances we see monuments with
the wall pierced with a circular opening or combining an interior crypt
with an external mound and dolmen, it is impossible to look upon these
close resemblances as the result of an accidental coincidence, and
equally impossible to fail to conclude that the men whose funeral rites
were remarkable for such close similarity belonged to the same
race.</p>
<p>What then was this race? Are these monuments witnesses of the great
Aryan immigration which was for so long supposed to have spread from
India over the continents of Asia and Europe, and of which the
Indo-European languages were said to preserve the memory? Or is it
really the fact that a relationship of language does not imply a
relationship of race? Were the builders of the dolmens Celts or Gauls,
Ligures or Cymri? was Henry Martin right in ascribing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4697" href="#xd21e4697" name=
"xd21e4697">229</a>]</span>to the Cimerii of Scandinavia the erection
in the Bronze age of the megaliths of Ireland? Was it the Turanians,
with their worship of ancestor&rsquo;s, their respect for the tombs of
their forefather&rsquo;s, and their desire to perpetuate their memory
to eternity, who set up the dolmens of Brittany? Was it not perhaps
rather the Iberians, whose descendants still people Spain and the north
of Africa? According to Maury, the distribution of the megalithic
monuments of Europe marks the last refuge of vanquished Neolithic
races, fleeing before their conquerors. All these hypotheses are
plausible, all can be defended by arguments, the weight of which it is
impossible to deny, but none are capable of conclusive proof, none can
finally convince the student.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4699src" href=
"#xd21e4699" name="xd21e4699src">33</a></p>
<p>An old Welsh poet, referring to the long barrows of his native land,
says that they are altogether inexplicable, and that it is impossible
to decide who set them up or who is buried beneath them. And surely
this ancient bard<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4707src" href="#xd21e4707"
name="xd21e4707src">34</a> is right even now. Vainly do we question
these silent witnesses of the remote past. They give us no answer, and
we can but repeat <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4710" href=
"#xd21e4710" name="xd21e4710">231</a>]</span>here what we said at the
beginning of this inquiry: Human science is powerless to lift the veil
biding the early history of humanity. Will it ever be so? Or will the
day yet dawn when the veil will be rent asunder at last? Time alone can
solve this question, which is one of those secrets of the future as
difficult to fathom as those of the past. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="first">When we consider the discoveries connected with the
Stone age as a whole, we are struck with the immense numbers of weapons
of every kind and of every variety of form found in different regions
of the globe. The Roman domination extended over a great part of the
Old World, and it lasted for many centuries. Everywhere this people,
illustrious amongst the nations, has left tokens of its power and of
its industry. Roman weapons, jewelry, and coins occupy considerable
spaces in our museums; but numerous as are these relics of the Romans,
they are far inferior in number to the objects dating from prehistoric
times, and flints worked by the hand of man have been picked up by
thousands in the last few years, forming incontestable witnesses of the
rapid growth of a large population.</p>
<p>One important point remains obscure. Schmerling has excavated fifty
caves in Belgium, and only found human relics in two or three of them;
and of six hundred explored by Lund in Brazil, only six contained human
bones. Similar results were obtained in the excavations of the mounds
of North America, as well as in the caves of France. M. Hamy, in a book
published a few years ago, only mentions twelve finds of human bones,
which could, without any doubt, be <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e4723" href="#xd21e4723" name="xd21e4723">232</a>]</span>dated
from Pal&aelig;olithic times. True, this number has been added to by
recent discoveries, but it is still quite insignificant. It is the same
thing with the kitchen-middings and the Lake settlements. This paucity
of actual human remains forms a gap in the evidence relating to
prehistoric man, which disturbances and displacements do not
sufficiently account for, and to which we shall refer again when
speaking of prehistoric tombs.</p>
<p>Worked flints are generally found in numbers in one place, probably
formerly a station or centre of human habitation. Men were beginning to
form themselves into societies, and the dwellings, first of the family
and then of the tribe, rapidly gathered together near some river rich
in fish, or some forest stocked with game affording plenty of food
easily obtained. The caves also afford proofs of the number of men who
inhabited them. In one alone, near Cracow, Ossowski discovered 876 bone
implements, more than 3,000 flint objects, and thousands of fragments
of pottery. From the Veyrier cave, near Mount Sal&egrave;ve, were taken
nearly 1,000 stone implements; from those of Petit Morin, 2,000
arrow-heads; from that of C&ocirc;ttes, on the banks of the Gartampe,
more than 264 pounds&rsquo; weight of flints, some of the
Moust&eacute;rien and others of the Madeleine type, mixed with the
bones of the rhinoceros, and of several large beasts of prey of
indeterminate species. The Abb&eacute; Ducrost picked up 4,000 flints
in one dwelling alone at Solutr&eacute;, where the soil is calcareous
and flint is not native, so that it must have been brought from a
distance. More than 8,000 different objects were taken from the fine
Neolithic station of Ors in the isle of Oleron; 12,000 chips of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4727" href="#xd21e4727" name=
"xd21e4727">233</a>]</span>stone, bearing marks of human workmanship,
were picked up in the Thayngen Cave, and more than 80,000 in the
different caves of Belgium. The shelter of Chaleux alone yielded 30,000
pieces of stone, at every stage of workmanship, from the waste of the
manufactory to the highly finished implement. Other explorers have been
no less fortunate. The Marquis of Wavrin found in the environs of Grez
no less than 60,000 worked stones belonging to no less than thirty
different types, chiefly arrow-heads, some triangular, others
almond-shaped, others again cutting transversely, some with and some
without feathers, some stalked, others not; in a word, arrows of every
known type. Nothing but an actual visit to the Royal Museum of Brussels
can give any idea of the importance of the discoveries made in
Belgium.</p>
<p>The environs of Paris are, however, no less rich. As early as
Pal&aelig;olithic times the valleys of the Seine and its tributaries
were evidently inhabited by a numerous population. M. Rivi&egrave;re
mentions a station near Clamart, where, in a limited space, he picked
up more than 900 flints, some worked, others mere chips, many of which
bad been subjected to heat. A sand-pit of Levallois-Perret yielded
4,000 stone objects, and on the plateau of Champigny, full of such
terrible memories for the people of France, were found nearly 1,200
flints, knives, polished hatchets, lance heads and scrapers, mixed with
numerous fragments of hand-made pottery without ornamentation.</p>
<p>Are yet other examples needed? At. de Mortillet estimates at more
than 25,000 the number of specimens found on the plateau of Saint
Acheul, the scene of the earliest discoveries that revealed the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4733" href="#xd21e4733" name=
"xd21e4733">234</a>]</span>existence of man in Quaternary times; and
the station of Concise, on Lake Neuch&acirc;tel, which is one of the
most ancient in Switzerland, yielded a yet more considerable number.
Many have, however, been lost or destroyed; the ballast of the railway
skirting the lake contains thousands of worked stones and of pieces of
the waste left in making them, all of which were taken from the bed of
the lake. It must not be forgotten that it is only of late years that
the importance of these relics of the past has been recognized and that
any one has dreamt of preserving or of studying them.</p>
<p>The excavation of a gravel pit at Dundrum (County Down, Ireland)
yielded 1,100 flint implements, and M. Belluci himself picked up in the
province of P&eacute;rouse more than 17,000 pieces, chiefly spear-,
lance-, or arrow-heads, belonging to six different types. The Broholm
Museum contains 72,409 weapons and implements, all found in
Denmark.</p>
<p>We can quote similar facts in other countries. Prehistoric stations
are numerous in the Sahara and throughout the Wady el Mya, in Algeria,
and we have already spoken of the numerous specimens found near Wargla.
The workshops in this district are generally surrounded by immense
numbers of ostrich eggs, which seem to indicate that that bird was
already domesticated.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4739src" href=
"#xd21e4739" name="xd21e4739src">1</a></p>
<p>In America, Dr. Abbott has sent to the Peabody Museum more than
20,000 stones, which were collected by him at Trenton, on the banks of
the Delaware, and quite recently I was told that in sinking a well in
Illinois the workmen came upon a deposit of more than 1,000 worked
flints, all of oval form. Every one knows the importance of the recent
discoveries at <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4747" href=
"#xd21e4747" name="xd21e4747">235</a>]</span>Washington, and we might
multiply examples <i>ad infinitum</i>, for everywhere explorers come
upon undoubted traces of the active work and intelligence of
comparatively dense populations, all of whom had attained to about the
same degree of development.</p>
<p>These numerous deposits often mark the, site of regular workshops,
tokens of the earliest attempt at social organization. In no other way
can we explain the piles of flints in every stage of workmanship lying
beside the lumps from which they were detached. One of the most
celebrated of these workshops is that of Grand-Pressigny, chief town of
the canton of the department of Indre-et-Loire, which is admirably
situated between two picturesque rivers, the Claise and the Creuse.</p>
<p>The flint implements of Grand-Pressigny, of which specimens can be
seen in all the museums of Europe, are some sixteen inches long, of
light color, pointed at one end and square at the other. One face is
rough, the other chipped into three oblong pieces, whilst the sides are
roughly hewn into saw-like teeth. If we examine these flints closely we
can easily make out the exact point, the <i>eye</i>, as workmen call
it, where the stone was struck. At Charbonni&egrave;re, on the banks of
the Sa&ocirc;ne, to quote other examples, in a radius of less than a
mile, were found weapons, tools, and nuclei, which may be compared with
those of Grand-Pressigny. In some places the collections of flints
still remaining look as if they had been used for road-making. In some
cases hatchets, knives, and scrapers seem to have been buried in pits.
Were these the reserve stores of the tribe, or the so-called
<i>caches</i> of the merchants? <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e4763" href="#xd21e4763" name="xd21e4763">236</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is difficult merely to name the different workshops or
manufactories discovered in the last few years. We must, however,
endeavor to mention the most important, for these workshops, we must
repeat, are an important proof of the existence of a society of
organized working communities. We meet with them on the shores of the
bay of Kiel, in the island of Anholt, in the midst of the Kattegat, and
on the borders of the Petchoura, and of the Soula, among the Samoieds.
Virchow discovered an arrow-head manufactory on the shores of Lake
Burtneek, and in 1884 the Moscow Society of Natural Sciences made known
the existence of important workshops near the Vetluga River, in the
province of Kostroma, so that we know that in remote prehistoric times
men lived and fought in a rigorous climate in districts but sparsely
populated in our own day.</p>
<p>There is nothing to surprise us in all these facts. Recently near
the Yenesei River, in the heart of Siberia, were found bronze daggers,
hatchets and bridle bits (<a href="#fig071">Fig. 71</a>), all bearing
witness in the beauty of their workmanship to a more advanced state of
civilization than the Lake Dwellings or megalithic monuments farther
south. Many of them are ornamented with figures of animals, so that at
an epoch less remote, it is true, than the one we have been
considering, but still far removed from our own, we find that there was
an intelligent race, with artistic tastes, living in a country now so
intensely cold as to be uninhabitable to all but a few miserable nomad
Tartars.</p>
<p>At Spiennes, near Mons, a field was discovered, known as the <i>camp
des cayaux</i>, strewn with flints, some uncut, others hewn, together
with knives and hatchets innumerable. There were also centres of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4776" href="#xd21e4776" name=
"xd21e4776">237</a>]</span>manufacture at Hoxne and Brandon, in
England, at Bellaria in Bologna, and at Rome on the Tiburtine Way. At
Ponte-Molle, where worked flints were discovered for the first time in
Italy a few years ago, a workshop was found, remarkable for the great
number of stags&rsquo; antlers, from which the middle part had been
removed, doubtless to be used as handles for tools. M. de Rossi, who
gives us these details, thinks that this station was inhabited in the
Paleolithic period. In the settlement of Concise have been found not
only stone implements, but a great many articles made of bone, so that
this place was evidently an important manufacturing centre. Knives,
stilettos, and arrow heads were turned out here, and in the hands of
skilful workmen the tusks of the boars, which abounded at this time in
Switzerland, were converted into excellent chisels.</p>

<p>To name the districts where tools were manufactured in prehistoric
times in France would be to give a list of all the departments. In the
commune of Saint-Julien du Saut we find a large manufactory where every
division of the Stone age is fully represented, from the time of the
simply chipped hatchet to that of the polished implement of rare
perfection. Everything bears witness to the prolonged residence of man
in a neighborhood which offered the attraction of vast deposits of
chalk with bands of flint that supplied alike weapons and tools.
Amongst others, we must name the so-called <i>atelier de la
Treiche</i>, near Toul, which extends for an area of about a hundred
acres, that of Bonaruc, near Dax; surrounded by waste lands covered
with a scanty vegetation; that of Rochebertier (Charente), which
probably dates from the Madeleine period; and that of
Ecorche-B&oelig;uf, near P&eacute;rigueux. The Abb&eacute; Cochet tells
us of an atelier in the Aulne valley, and Maurice Sand of another near
La Ch&acirc;tre, where we meet with the most ancient traces of man in
Berry. In the fields, near an alignment not far from Autun, were picked
up numbers of hatchets of bard rock, barbed arrows, flakes of flint
worked into scrapers or chisels, whilst near them were the very
polishers on which they had been pointed.</p>
<p>We have just spoken of polishers, and we said some time ago that it
was by prolonged rubbing that the remarkable weapons of Neolithic times
were produced. We must add now that a whole series of the polishers
used are to be seen on the right bank of the Loing, near Nemours; one
of which is a regular table (<a href="#fig072">Fig. 72</a>), on which
can be made out no less than fifty grooves and twenty-five cup-like
depressions.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e4795width" id="fig072"><img src=
"images/fig072.jpg" alt="" width="422" height="291">
<p class="first">Prehistoric polisher, near the ford of Beaumoulin,
Nemours.</p>
</div>
<p>One would have expected to find the ground near these polishers
covered with flakes of flint and pieces of tools of all kinds, but
nothing of the kind has been discovered; a fact which leads its to
suppose that the workmen only came down into the valley to finish off
their weapons by polishing them.</p>
<p>At the period we are considering all the continents were peopled,
and we must repeat, for it is the most important point of our present
study, that the civilization attained to by the inhabitants was
everywhere almost identical. Thus we find centres of manufacture
similar to those of Europe at the foot of the mountains of Tunis and of
Algeria. In one of the latter, at Hassi al Rhatmaia, the knives were
piled up in one place, the scrapers in another, and the arrow-heads in
a third. In this disposition M. Rabourdin thinks he sees a sign of the
division of labor, one of the most important features of modern
progress. M. Arcelin mentions a similar deposit on the summit of the
Jebel Kalabshee, near Esneh in Egypt, and a few years ago another was
found in Palestine, near the ancient Berytus, containing great numbers
of hatchets, saws, scrapers, and all the implements characteristic of
the Stone age; whilst amongst them lay the blocks from which they had
been cut. Asia Minor was evidently an important manufacturing centre
during the Stone age, and, as a matter of course, it must have had a
considerable population; and even in America discoveries of similar
extent have been made. At Kinosha, in Wisconsin, Lapham made out a
manufactory of flint and quartzite arrow-heads, which dates from
prehistoric times, and quite recently a yet more important centre of
industry has been discovered at St. Andrew (Winnipeg). <span class=

<p>The manufactories of Spiennes and Brandon deserve special notice, as
they show us how our ancestors got the flint they used instead of
metal. At Spiennes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4806src" href=
"#xd21e4806" name="xd21e4806src">2</a> the excavations were begun in
the open air, then the chalk containing the flint was reached by the
sinking of vertical shafts, many of which were as much as forty feet in
depth. These shafts were connected with each other by galleries running
in every direction, but always following the belts of flints. Cuttings
have brought to light the very implements of the ancient miners. They
were of the simplest description, such as picks made of stag-horn and
heavy stone hammers, all alike bearing marks of long service.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4809src" href="#xd21e4809" name=
"xd21e4809src">3</a></p>
<p>Similar results were obtained in England. Canon Greenwell explored
near Brandon, in Suffolk, a series of 254 shafts, known in the
neighborhood as Grime&rsquo;s Graves. As at Spiennes, the shafts were
connected by galleries from three to five feet high, and one of theta
was twenty-seven feet long. The shafts and galleries had been hollowed
out with the help of picks exactly like those found in Belgium;
seventy-nine were picked up that had been thrown away by the
workmen.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4821src" href="#xd21e4821" name=
"xd21e4821src">4</a></p>
<p>Some few years ago MM. Cartailhac and Boule discovered one of these
primitive quarries at Mur de Barrez, the chief town of the department
of Aveyron.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4828src" href="#xd21e4828" name=
"xd21e4828src">5</a></p>
<p>They made out eight shafts in the face of a layer of limestone some
eighty-one feet long, and at every turn of their excavations they came
to fresh shafts. These <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4838" href=
"#xd21e4838" name="xd21e4838">242</a>]</span>shafts opened out towards
the top like funnels, and they were not more than three feet three
inches below the surface, the flint having been struck at that depth
(<a href="#fig073">Fig. 73</a>). These shafts were, in many cases,
continued by galleries, as seen in our illustration (<a href=
"#fig074">Fig. 74</a>), or by trenches, where the light is, however,
more or less shut out by small landslips. It is still easy, in spite of
this, to make out the floor of the mine, for it is trodden hard by the
feet of the ancient miners. Traces of charcoal, too, reveal the path
they took, and we learn at the same time that they used fire to help
them in their work.</p>

</div>
<p>M. Boule,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4865src" href="#xd21e4865"
name="xd21e4865src">6</a> from whom we borrow these details, cannot
restrain his astonishment at the practical knowledge shown by these
prehistoric miners. He tells us that they sometimes left the flint
standing as pillars at pretty short intervals, or they propped up the
galleries with even more resistant material, cementing them with
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4870" href="#xd21e4870" name=
"xd21e4870">243</a>]</span>clay or with calcareous earth taken from the
detritus. In spite of these precautions, landslips frequently occurred,
and implements of stag-horn (<a href="#fig075">Fig. 75</a>) have often
been flattened by the fall of the roof of the gallery. It is really
curious to find implements of an exactly similar kind used for exactly
similar purposes at Spiennes, Brandon, Mur de Barrez, and at Cissbury,
to which, however, we shall have to refer again. In the shafts of
Aveyron, as in those of England, the marks of blows of the picks are
still to be seen, and in many cases a flint or horn-pick point is still
imbedded in the rock or limestone, as if the miner had but just left
his work.</p>

<p class="first">Plan of a gallery, half destroyed in making the

</div>
<p>In this last example of what has been done in France, we must also
add that of the shafts of Nointel (Oise) and those discovered in Maine
by M. de Baye, in both of which were found nodules of flint in
different stages of preparation, together with some stag-horn picks. In
none of these excavations was any <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e4882" href="#xd21e4882" name="xd21e4882">244</a>]</span>metal
implement found, or any trace of the use of metal, so that we must
conclude that the mines date from Neolithic times.</p>
<p>We have seen how man gradually brought to perfection the tools and
weapons which were at first so clumsy. The growth of industry led to
the birth of commerce, or, to speak more accurately, to that of barter.
From the time of the earliest migrations intercourse was begun, or
rather was carried on, between the tribes, as they gradually dispersed,
often travelling considerable distances from each other, and fresh
proofs of these relations are continually brought to light as we become
better acquainted with prehistoric times. The flints worked by the
cave-men of Belgium, the fossil shells so numerous at Chaleux, in the
Frontal and Nuton caves, at Thayngen on the frontier between
Switzerland and Germany, in Italy, in the stations of anterior date to
the <i>terremare</i> beds, have been found the shells of the pearl
oyster of the Indian Ocean, whilst in the caves of the south of France,
such as the Madeleine, that of Cro-Magnon, Bize in H&eacute;rault, and
Solutr&eacute; on the banks of the Sa&ocirc;ne have been picked up the
shells of Arctic marine mollusca. The cave-man of Gourdan was decked
with shells from the Mediterranean, and the man of Mentone in his turn
wore a head-dress made of Atlantic shells. Fossil shells were also much
sought after; we have alluded to those from Champagne found in Belgium;
others from the shell-marl of Touraine and Anjou had been taken into
the caves of P&eacute;rigord, whilst sea-urchins from the cretaceous
strata of the south of France were found in a prehistoric station of
Auvergne, and M. Massenat picked up at Laugerie-Basse two specimens of
a species <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4889" href="#xd21e4889"
name="xd21e4889">245</a>]</span>not met with anywhere but in the Eocene
deposits of the isle of Wight. The Neolithic station of Champigny, near
Paris, has yielded some objects from the Alps, and from Belgium, from
the Vosges Mountains, and the Puy de D&ocirc;me.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e4892width" id="fig075"><img src=
"images/fig075.jpg" alt="" width="258" height="424">
<p class="first">Picks, hammers, and mattocks made of stag-horn.</p>
</div>
<p>In the caves of P&eacute;rigord were also found fragments of hyaline
quartz, which must have been brought from the Alps or the Pyrenees. In
Brittany and in Marne flints foreign to these granite districts are
numerous; and Dr. Pruni&egrave;res tells us that similar discoveries
were made under the megalithic monuments of France, and that neither in
the eroded limestone districts of Loz&egrave;re, known locally as
<i>les causses</i>, nor under the dolmens of Haute-Vienne, were found
any but implements made of rock not native to the country.</p>
<p>Hatchets, daggers, and nuclei, or as they are characteristically
called by the country <span class="corr" id="xd21e4903" title=
"Source: peope">people</span> <i>livres de beurre</i>, from
Grand-Pressigny, have been picked up in the bed of the Seine, at
Limagne in Auvergne, in Brittany, at Saint M&eacute;dard near Bordeaux,
on the banks of the Meuse, and even as far north as the Shetland
Islands. At Concise was found red coral from the Mediterranean, whilst
the yellow amber of the Baltic was picked up in the Lake Dwellings of
Switzerland, beneath the dolmens of Brittany, in sepulchral caves, such
as those of Oyes (Marne) or Lombrives (Ari&egrave;ge), beneath the
megalithic tomb of La Roquette, at Saint Pargoue (H&eacute;rault)
beneath the dolmen of Grailhe (Gard), at Malpas, and at Baume
(Ard&egrave;che).<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4909src" href="#xd21e4909"
name="xd21e4909src">7</a> These <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e4921" href="#xd21e4921" name="xd21e4921">247</a>]</span>are
nearly all Neolithic tombs, though some few of them may date from the
beginning of the Bronze age; but the cave-men of France owned amber
even earlier than this, for five fragments have been found in the
Aurensan Cave near Bagn&egrave;res-de-Bigorre, which was inhabited in
Pal&aelig;olithic times. Jadeite and nephrite<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4923src" href="#xd21e4923" name="xd21e4923src">8</a> are met with
in the Lake Dwellings of Switzerland and Bavaria, as in the caves of
Liguria and Sardinia; chloromelanite<a class="noteref" id=

and obsidian<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4942src" href="#xd21e4942"
name="xd21e4942src">10</a> in Lorraine, in the island of Pianosa and in
the Cyclades. We have already spoken of the cala&iuml;te<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4945src" href="#xd21e4945" name=
"xd21e4945src">11</a> found beneath the dolmens of Brittany, and we may
add now that it has also been found in the caves of Portugal and
beneath the megalithic monuments of the south of France.</p>
<p>Commerce developed rapidly during Neolithic times, and, as far as we
can make out from traces left, its course was from the southeast to the
northwest. Streams and rivers were followed by merchants as by
emigrants, and at an extremely remote date the sea no longer arrested
the journeys of men. At a recent meeting of the British Anthropological
Institute, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4957" href="#xd21e4957"
name="xd21e4957">248</a>]</span>Miss Buckland dwelt on the resemblance
in the material, shape, and ornamentation of a golden cup found in
Cornwall, to other cups found at Myken&aelig; and at Tarquinii, and
maintained that the Cornish cup must have been the work of the same
artisans, and have been brought by commerce from what was then the
extremity of the known world.</p>
<p>It is not only in Europe that we can trace the relations established
between men separated by vast distances, by oceans, and by apparently
impassable deserts. The shells of the Atlantic and those of the
Pacific, the copper of Lake Superior, the mica of the Alleghanies, and
the obsidian of Mexico lie together beneath the tumuli of Ohio, and
quite recently Mr. Putnam exhibited to the Society of Antiquaries a
collection of jade celts and ornaments, some from Nicaragua, others
from Costa Rica, and a hatchet with both edges sharpened from Michigan.
No deposit of jade has so far been discovered on the American
continent, so that we can only suppose these objects to have been
brought from Asia at an unknown date. The marks they retain of having
been rubbed up, and the holes made in them to hang them up, show what
store was set by them.</p>
<p>Monuments of many kinds scattered over different countries, weapons
and implements, relics as they are of a remote past, enable us to gain
a closer insight into the manners, customs, and mode of life of our
ancestors of the Stone age. We can picture their daily life, which we
know to have been one long struggle, without break or truce, for they
had to contend, not only with wild animals but with each other, to
fight for the use of their caves of refuge, for their hunting fields,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4963" href="#xd21e4963" name=
"xd21e4963">249</a>]</span>and for their watercourses; and later, the
first shepherds had to do battle for the pasturage necessary for their
flocks. It is only too certain that, from the earliest dawn of
humanity, men gave way, without any effort at self-control, to their
brutal passions. The right of the strongest was the only law, and
wherever man penetrated his course was marked by violence and by death.
One of the femora of an old man was found in the celebrated Cro-Magnon
Cave, bearing a deep depression caused by a blow of a projectile, and
on the forehead of the woman that lay beside him is a large wound made
by a small flint hatchet (<a href="#fig076">Fig. 76</a>). This gash on
the frontal bone penetrated the skull, and was probably the cause of
death, but not of sudden death, for round about the wound are marks of
an attempt at healing it.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4968src" href=
"#xd21e4968" name="xd21e4968src">12</a> According to Dr. Hamy, many of
the bones found in the Sordes Cave have very curious wounds. A gaping
hole on the right parietal of a woman must have been a terrible wound
(<a href="#fig077">Fig. 77</a>). The woman of Sordes, like that of
Cro-Magnon, must have survived for some time; the marks of the removal
of splinters of bone, which can quite easily be made out, leave no
doubt on that point.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4974src" href=

<p>In the Baumes-Chaudes caves, situated in that part <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4984" href="#xd21e4984" name=
"xd21e4984">250</a>]</span>of the valley of the Tarn which belongs to
the department of Loz&egrave;re, Dr. Pruni&egrave;res picked up
numerous bones bearing scars, characteristic of wounds produced by
stone weapons.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4986src" href="#xd21e4986"
name="xd21e4986src">14</a> Some fifteen of these bones, such as the
right and left hip bones, tibi&aelig;, and vertebrae, still contain
flint points flung with sufficient force to penetrate deeply the bony
tissue. Always indefatigable in his researches, Dr. Pruni&egrave;res
also mentions having found in the cave known as that of
<i>L&rsquo;Homme Mort</i> bones bearing traces of cicatrized wounds,
and he presented to the Scientific Congress at Clermont a human
vertebra found beneath the Aum&egrave;de dolmen pierced with an
arrow-head, which is, so to speak, encased in the wound by the
formation of bony tissue.</p>

<p class="first">Skull of a woman found at Sordes, showing a severe

</div>
<p>Of the nineteen crania found in the Neolithic sepulchre of
Vaur&eacute;al two show traces of old wounds. One of them, that of a
woman, has three different scars, two of which were of wounds that had
healed, whilst the third in the occiput was a gaping hole, which had
evidently caused death.</p>
<p>A sepulchral cave at Nogent-les-Vierges (Oise) contains the skeleton
of a man with a wound on the forehead, no less than four and a half
inches long by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5003" href=
"#xd21e5003" name="xd21e5003">251</a>]</span>three broad. This man, who
was dune young, the sutures being still very apparent, survived this
serious wound for some time.</p>
<p>The Gourdan Cave has yielded crania and jaws broken by blunt
weapons, whilst on other crania have been made out scratches and
stripes which could only have been produced after the hair and skin had
been removed. In the caves of the Petit-Morin valley, M. de Baye picked
up some human vertebra pierced with flints, the points of which were
still imbedded in the bones. In the Villevenard Cave one skull was
found containing three arrow-beads with transverse points imbedded in
the skull, the bone of which had closed upon them. Another arrow was
lodged between the dorsal vertebrae. It is probable that these arrows
had remained in the wounds; certainly that is the simplest way to
account for their position. About two miles from the caves of which we
have been speaking, M. de Baye discovered a sepulchre containing thirty
skeletons, all of adult and strongly built individuals. The bodies were
laid one above the other, and separated by large flat stones and a thin
layer of earth. This sepulchral cave contained seventy-three flint
points. As in the case of Villevenard, their position leads us to
suppose that these points had been sticking in the flesh of the bodies
when they were interred, and had fallen out when decomposition set in.
Probably the bodies were those of men who had fallen victims in a
bloody conflict that had taken place in the valley. In a cave at the
station of Oyes, was found stretched upon a bed of stones a skeleton
with a piece of flint, which had been flung with great force, imbedded
in the upper part of the humerus. Round <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e5007" href="#xd21e5007" name="xd21e5007">252</a>]</span>about the
wound are the marks of many attempts at healing it.</p>
<p>Many of the human bones found in the Vivarais Cave bear traces of
having been violently fractured by stone weapons with tapering points.
In the Challes Cave (Savoy) lies the skeleton of a woman whose skull
was fractured by a flint weapon, but in this case death was evidently
immediate, at least if we may judge from the fact that there are no
signs of the wound having received any treatment. In the Castellet
Cave, a human vertebra contained the weapon which had pierced it, but
when the bone was touched the arrow-head broke off. It had, however,
been flung with such a sure hand that it had been driven ten inches
deep into the bony tissue. Here, too, the absence of any exostosis
proves that death quickly followed the wound.</p>

<p class="first">Fragment of human tibia with exostosis enclosing the
end of a flint arrow.</p>
</div>
<p>In other cases the victims seem to have lived for some time. We have
already spoken of wounds in crania that had healed, and we may add that
a few years ago a human bone was presented to the Arch&aelig;ological
Society of Bordeaux which still retained a flint arrow-head in the
wound it had made. Traces could clearly be made out of the inflammation
caused <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5019" href="#xd21e5019" name=
"xd21e5019">253</a>]</span>by the presence of the foreign body, and the
bony tissue secreted by the periosteum had, so to speak, taken the
mould of the arrow (<a href="#fig078">Fig. 78</a>).</p>
<p>In the cave known as the Trou d&rsquo;Argent (Basses-Alpes) amongst
the bones of ruminants and carnivora, fragments of pottery and rubbish
of all kinds, was found a piece of humerus (<a href="#fig079">Fig.
79</a>) pierced at the elbow joint and very neatly cut at the lower
end, no doubt with the help of some of the implements of hard rock
scattered about the cave. The position of this human bone amongst the
remains of animals and fragments of a meal, points to its being a relic
of a scene of cannibalism; adding yet another proof to what I said at
the beginning of this work.</p>

<p>Similar facts are reported front England and Germany. Dr. Wankel
mentions an interesting prehistoric deposit at Prerau, near Olmutz,
amongst the bones of animals belonging to the most ancient Quaternary
fauna, such as the mammoth, the cave-bear, the cave-lion, the glutton,
and the arctic fox; and amongst <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e5036" href="#xd21e5036" name="xd21e5036">254</a>]</span>clumsy
bone and ivory weapons and ornaments he found a human jaw and a femur
covered with strip produced by flint hatchets. In 1801 Mr. Cunnington
took several skeletons from a barrow near Heytesbury, the skull of one
of which had been broken with a blunt implement; and Sir R. Hoare
speaks of a skull from the neighborhood of Stonehenge split open by a
blow from one of these formidable weapons. Several crania taken from a
long barrow at West Kennet have similar wounds.</p>
<p>Similar facts were noticed at Littleton-Drew, at Uley, at Cotswold,
and at Rodmarten, and from this Dr. Thurmam concluded that nearly all
those who were buried in long barrows had met with a violent
death.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5040src" href="#xd21e5040" name=
"xd21e5040src">15</a> He speaks, however, of one skull pierced with a
large hole, the edges of which had become rounded smooth, showing the
action of a recuperative process, and proving that the injured man had
long survived his serious wound. In 1809, a farmer of
Kirkcudbrightshire set to work to demolish a large cairn that
interfered with his tilling of the soil, and which, according to
popular tradition, was the tomb of a Scotch king. In taking away the
earth the workmen found a large stone coffin, in which lay the skeleton
of a man of great stature. The arm had been almost separated from the
trunk by the blow of a diorite hatchet, a broken bit of which remained
imbedded in the bone.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5046src" href=
"#xd21e5046" name="xd21e5046src">16</a></p>
<p>One of the few crania that can with certainty be said to have
belonged to Lake Dwellers of Switzerland was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5051" href="#xd21e5051" name=
"xd21e5051">255</a>]</span>found at Sutz, near Zurich; this skull was
fractured at the back. The roundness of the wound, which had been
serious enough to cause death, has led authorities to conclude that it
was made with one of the formidable pick-hammers, so many of which were
found in the lake of Bienne.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5053src" href=
"#xd21e5053" name="xd21e5053src">17</a> Nilsson speaks of a human

crania have been found bearing the marks of mortal wounds, and if we
cross the Atlantic we meet with similar instances. Lund tells us that
at Lagoa do Sumidouro crania were found pierced with circular tools,
whilst near them lay the implements that had caused death.<a class=

found with a flint knife imbedded in one of the bones, and at
Madisonville (Ohio) another, one of the bones of which was pierced by a
triangular stone arrow; whilst beneath a mound in Indiana was picked up
a skull pierced by a flint arrow more than six inches long. Excavations
at Copiapo (Chili) brought to light the skeleton of a man who had
sustained no less than eight wounds from arrows. The force with which
they must have been shot is really astonishing; one had broken the
upper jaw and knocked out several teeth, penetrating to the brain; and
others were still sticking in the vertebrae and ribs.<a class="noteref"

wounds, and a skull found <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5075"

Devil&rsquo;s River shows a serious wound inflicted many years before
death, and one of the Peruvian crania in the Peabody Museum bears a
long frontal fracture, doubtless produced by the violent blow of a
club; the five or six fragments still to be made out are, so to speak,
solidified, and the wounded man had evidently lived on for many years,
thanks apparently to his good constitution alone, for there are no
signs of the performing of any surgical operation, such as the removal
of the splinters of bone, for instance.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>In 1884 a human vertebra, with an arrow-head imbedded in it, was
picked up on the island of Santa Cruz. The apophysis was broken, and
the extent of the fracture shows the great force of the blow. The
victim evidently died of the wound, for there is no sign of its having
been healed.</p>
<p>I have dwelt upon these deaths and wounds in spite of the inevitable
monotony of such a list, not because I wish to bring into prominence
the fact that from the earliest times the struggle for existence was
fierce and bloody, but because I am anxious to prove that in these
remote days an organized and intelligent society had grown up. No one
could have survived such wounds as we have described, but for the care
and nursing of those around him, such as the other members of his
family or of his tribe. The wounded one must have been fed by others
for months; nay more, he must have been carried in migrations, and his
food and resting-place must have been prepared for him. Moreover, and
this is of even yet more importance to our argument, they must have
been men able to treat wounds and to set bones. <span class=

<p>This last fact has been proved beyond a doubt by the discovery of
numerous bones with the old wounds completely cicatrized. &ldquo;In
several examples,&rdquo; says Dr. Pruni&egrave;res, speaking in this
connection, &ldquo;we can make out the fractures set with a neatness
which gives us a very high opinion of the skill of the Neolithic bone
setters. The setting of one fracture at the lower end of the tibia and
of another at the neck of the femur, are not inferior to what we should
expect from the most skilful surgeons of the globe.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5090src" href="#xd21e5090" name=
"xd21e5090src">22</a> A remarkable fact truly, but one often met with
in the most widely separated regions of the earth, the importance of
which cannot be overrated, and justifies the giving of a few more
details.</p>
<p>In 1873 Dr. Pruni&egrave;res, to whom science has reason to be very
grateful for his singular discovery, presented to the members of the
French Association, in session at Lyons, a human parietal with a
rounded piece of bone let into it. This piece of bone was rather larger
than a five-franc piece, and the skull into which it had been fixed was
found beneath the Loz&egrave;re dolmen. A large opening, some three
inches in diameter, the edges of which were worn smooth, had been made
in this skull, and the piece of bone let into it was thicker than the
skull itself, as well as different in color, the cranium being dark and
the foreign piece of bone pale yellow. It was evident therefore that
the two pieces did not belong in life to one person, and that the
rounded piece had been cut out of some other skull. The following year
Dr. Pruni&egrave;res added fresh details about other rounded
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5098" href="#xd21e5098" name=
"xd21e5098">258</a>]</span>pieces of skull that be had discovered let
into crania, some of which pieces had evidently been introduced during
the life of the patient, who had died under the operation of
trepanation, whilst others had been put in after death. Dr.
Pruni&egrave;res in every case speaks of <i>rondelles</i> or rounded
pieces of skulls, and we prefer to quote him exactly, but as a matter
of fact the trepanation was sometimes done with elliptical, triangular,
or even pyramidal pieces of bone.</p>
<p>Later no less than sixty fresh examples, corroborating Dr.
Pruni&egrave;res&rsquo; discoveries, were found in the Baumes-Chaudes
caves, and Broca in his turn reported the finding of three crania in
the cave of <i>L&rsquo;Homme Mort</i>, from which great pieces had been
taken which had evidently not been lost by accident.</p>
<p>From this time excavations and discoveries made under Dr.
Pruni&egrave;res succeeded each other rapidly. In 1887 his collection
contained 167 crania or fragments of crania, all perforated, 115 of
which were picked up in the caves of Loz&egrave;re, which are probably
of more recent date, beneath the dolmens of the <i>dev&egrave;zes</i>,
as those vast plains given lip to pasturage are called. These dolmens,
which were doubtless reserved for the burial of chiefs, often contain
many valuable objects. Beneath one, for instance, were found fifteen
beautiful darts of variegated flint, four polished boars&rsquo; tusks,
some schist pendants, some shells cut into the shape of teeth, some
bone and stone necklace beads, and, lastly, two small bronze beads.
These last-named objects justify us in dating the dolmen from the
Bronze epoch, when the use of bronze began to spread over the district,
though it was still not generally employed.</p>
<p>Attention once awakened, similar facts began to be <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5116" href="#xd21e5116" name=
"xd21e5116">259</a>]</span>announced from many different quarters. In
the Neolithic caves of Marne were found skulls with rounded holes in
them, pieces of skull such as are shown in <a href="#fig028">Fig.
28</a>, which were probably worn as amulets. M. de Baye has in his fine
collection more than twenty examples of trepanation, one of which is
shown in <a href="#fig080">Fig. 80</a>. In nearly every case the
operation had been performed after death; three examples alone show it
to have been done during life, and that the patient certainly survived,
for the wound shows very evident signs of having healed, and the edges
of the openings no longer bear the marks of the tool of the operator.
On one of the three crania there were two wounds near each other, but
they were quite separate, and were evidently not treated at the same
time.</p>

</div>
<p>A tumulus in the Guisseny commune (Finist&egrave;re), excavated
about two years ago, covered over a sepulchral crypt. At the
southeastern extremity was picked up a badly baked hand-made
earthenware vase with four handles. Beside the vase lay a skull, on
which could be made out traces of oxidation, which had probably been
caused by the wearing of a metal band, which has not been found. This
skull bears on the right side a little oval hole with cicatrized edges
about an inch long by two fifths <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e5131" href="#xd21e5131" name="xd21e5131">260</a>]</span>of an
inch broad. The discovery of a bronze dagger and two bronze plaques
leaves no doubt as to the age of this tumulus. This example of
trepanation is the only well authenticated one of which I know in
Brittany. It is true one skull has been mentioned as found beneath the
megalithic monument of Saint-Picoux de Quiberon (Morbihan), which is
even said to bear marks of sawing and scraping made in attempting
trepanation, but this fact has been very much questioned, and the date
at which the trepanation was performed, if performed it were, is very
doubtful.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5133src" href="#xd21e5133" name=
"xd21e5133src">23</a> The proof we are seeking of the antiquity of the
operation of trepanation is not therefore to be found here.</p>
<p>On a plain amongst the hills of the right bank of the Seine, above
Paris, rises a mound resembling a promontory which is known as the
Gu&eacute;rin mound, and consists of a vast deposit of chalk which was
excavated long ago. Successive operations have brought to light eight
caves, most of which contained a number of human remains, which were
unfortunately dispersed without having been scientifically examined.
One alone, opened in 1874, contained numerous bones belonging to
individuals of every age and of both sexes, with polished flints,
fragments of pottery, and implements of stag-horn. Amongst these relics
was found the skull of an old man showing a very curious example of
trepanation. It was unfortunately broken by the workmen in the very
moment of discovery, and could only be very insufficiently examined.
Other examples, however, which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5143"
href="#xd21e5143" name="xd21e5143">261</a>]</span>could be properly
authenticated, are not wanting from the banks of the Seine and Marne;
two fragments of skull were found in the canton of Moret, one of which
had been trepanned during the life of its owner, and the other after
death. We must also mention the crania presented to the learned
societies at the Sorbonne, one of which came from the plateau of
Avrigny, near Mousseaux-l&egrave;s-Bray (Seine-et-Marne). Side by side
with the skeleton lay polished hatchets, scrapers, and arrow-heads,
fragments of pottery blackened by smoke, and lastly a solitary bone of
an ox, pierced with three holes at regular distances, which had
probably been used as a flute. Of nine crania found in this excavation
three were pierced, two after death and one during life, the edges of
the last named bearing very evident traces of treatment.</p>
<p>A trepanned skull was also discovered in a Neolithic sepulchre near
Cr&eacute;cy-sur-Morin, where lay no less than thirty skeletons,
remarkable for the strongly defined section of the tibiae, whilst
around were strewn hatchets, flint knives, bones, stilettos and picks
of siliceous limestone with handles made of pieces of stag-horn. The
tomb, built of stones without mortar, contained two contiguous chambers
separated by a wall, and covered over by a stone weighing more than
1,200 tons. It seems likely that this huge stone had not been
moved&mdash;it must have been beyond the strength of the makers of the
tomb to lift it,&mdash;but that the spaces beneath, in which the dead
had been placed, had been merely hollowed out. In the covered <i>Avenue
des Mureaux</i>, of which I have already spoken, were picked up several
trepanned crania. The tools, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5150"
href="#xd21e5150" name="xd21e5150">262</a>]</span>scrapers, and
piercers, which had probably been used for the operation, lay near the
crania.</p>
<p>A Neolithic sepulchre containing three trepanned crania was opened
at Dampont, near Dieppe. The operation had been as neatly executed as
if it had been performed by one of our most distinguished surgeons. As
at Cr&eacute;cy, the sepulchral crypt was divided into two chambers,
and the slab between them was pierced with a square opening,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5154src" href="#xd21e5154" name=
"xd21e5154src">24</a>&mdash;a fresh example of the curious practice of
making openings, of which we have spoken in treating of so many
different regions, often apparently completely cut off from
communication with each other.</p>
<p>Beneath the Bougon dolmen (Deux-S&egrave;vres), in the west of
France, was found a skull, and at Lizi&egrave;res in the same
department, the skeleton of a tall old man with a dolichocephalic skull
and platycnemic tibi&aelig; bearing traces of old wounds badly healed.
The bony tissue of the skull was in an unhealthy state and the
trepanation had evidently been part of medical treatment. At
Saint-Martin-la-Rivi&eacute;re (Vienna), a tomb dating from Neolithic
times contained five trepanned crania, on one of which the perforation
had been made by scraping. In this tomb was also found a round piece of
skull with a hole in it, which had doubtless been used as a pendant.
The other objects found in this sepulchre were of a remarkable
character, and included hatchets made of coralline limestone, jade,
fibrolite, and serpentine, the blades of flint knives, arrows, some
feathered, others stalked, some necklace beads, and a number of vases,
some apodal, others with flat stands, and nearly all without any
attempt at ornamentation. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5161"
href="#xd21e5161" name="xd21e5161">263</a>]</span>Beneath a dolmen near
St. Affrique, M. Cartailhac discovered a skull with two holes in it;
one near the bregma, which had been made during life, and the other on
a level with the lambda, which had not been made until after
death.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5163src" href="#xd21e5163" name=
"xd21e5163src">25</a> We cannot now note the important conclusions
founded on these two perforations, we must be content with adding here
that the tomb contained four other skeletons with crania showing no
trace of trepanation; the tibiae were platycnemic and the humeri had
the so-called perforation of the olecranon farces, which certain
anthropologists, as I think without sufficient reason, consider
characteristic of inferior races. We must mention yet one more
discovery which it will not do to omit. A human parietal with a piece
missing that had evidently been taken out, was found beneath the
rock-shelter of Entre-Roches near Angoul&ecirc;me. The skull bore very
evident traces of the performance of an operation which may or may not
have been executed during life. Was it done to remove the diseased
bone&mdash;for it was diseased&mdash;in the hope of prolonging life?
Did the patient die under the hands of the surgeon, or was the piece of
bone taken out after death to be used as an ornament or an amulet? Any
one of these hypotheses is possible, and all we can say for certain is
that there is no sign of the wound having been healed in any way. This
is a common thing enough, and the interest of the discovery arises from
a different cause. The rock-shelter of Entre-Roches is supposed to date
from Paleolithic times, and if it were certain that there has been no
displacement of the soil on which the parietal was found, it is to be
concluded that trepanation was practised in the Quaternary <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5168" href="#xd21e5168" name=
"xd21e5168">264</a>]</span>period when man was living amongst the large
extinct pachydermata and felid&aelig;. But it will be difficult to
admit this unless other discoveries confirming it are made. If,
however, we cannot prove that trepanation was practised in France in
Pal&aelig;olithic times, we can assert that it was continued down to
the earliest centuries of the Christian era. One remarkable case of
trepanation was found, for instance, in the Merovingian cemetery near
St. Quentin; and a trepanned skull was recently exhibited at a meeting
of the Anthropological Society in Paris, which had been found beneath a
Merovingian tomb at Jeuilly. The patient had long survived his wound.
The skeleton was found in a stone trough, narrower at the foot than at
the head. The skeleton of a man between forty and fifty years of age
was found in a Frank cemetery at Limet, near Li&egrave;ge. On the left
parietal of the skull was an oval hole as big as a pigeon&rsquo;s egg,
bearing traces of having been medically treated. The patient, like the
man of Jeuilly, certainly survived the operation. His tomb, as were the
resting-places of his neighbors in death, was covered over with a huge
unhewn stone, and beside him lay another skeleton. A few nails and bits
of wood were the only things found in the tomb. We may also mention the
skeleton of a Frank of between fifty-five and sixty-five years of age
with a trepanned skull, found by M. Pilloy, in a cemetery of the St.
Quentin <i>arrondissement</i>, which also contained numerous objects
dating from the sixth century A.D.</p>
<p>So far we have only spoken of France, but similar facts are reported
all over Europe, and the difficulty really is to make a selection. Some
round pieces of skull, like those of Loz&egrave;re, have been picked up
in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5175" href="#xd21e5175" name=
"xd21e5175">265</a>]</span>Umbria<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5177src"
href="#xd21e5177" name="xd21e5177src">26</a>; and a skull, bearing
traces of an operation, the aim of which was to remove a portion of the
left parietal, was found in the Casa da Mouva (Portugal), which dates,
as do so many in France, from Neolithic times.</p>
<p>Goss mentions a discovery in one of the pile-dwellings of Lake
Bienne, of a skull with a large hole in it with bevelled edges. There
is no trace of this wound having healed, and the patient had evidently
died soon after the operation.</p>
<p>The Prague Museum possesses two crania found at Bilin in Bohemia;
one, of a pronounced dolichocephalic type, has near the middle of the
right parietal an opening measuring one and a half by two and a third
inches; the cicatrization is complete, and trepanation was evidently
performed long before death. The other is mesaticephalic, and bears a
round opening about one and a half inches in diameter. Dr. Wankel, to
whom we owe these details, is well known through other discoveries; his
excavations in the Bytchiskala Cave brought to light the skeleton of a
young girl of ten or twelve years old, who bad undergone the operation
of trepanation. The wound, which was on the right side of the forehead,
was half healed. The child still wore the ornaments she had been fond
of in life&mdash;bronze bracelets and a necklace of large glass
beads.</p>
<p>Discoveries of a similar character succeeded each other in Bohemia,
and in nearly every case the operation of trepanation had been
performed on the upper part of the forehead. Not very long ago it was
reported to the Anthropological Society of Berlin that in excavating
two tombs containing the remains of burnt bodies at Tr&uuml;pschutz, on
the west of Brux, some <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5190" href=
"#xd21e5190" name="xd21e5190">266</a>]</span>fragments of skull were
picked up, showing traces of trepanation. The edges of the wound in
this case bad been healed, and the patient had lived on after the
operation. Professor Virchow came to the same conclusion with regard to
a skull from a Neolithic tomb which bore on the right parietal traces
of an ancient cicatrized wound. He also tells us of the finding in
Poland of a round piece of skull which had evidently been worn as an
amulet.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5192src" href="#xd21e5192" name=
"xd21e5192src">27</a></p>
<p>In the north of Europe similar discoveries have been made. At
Borreby, in Denmark, a skull was found from which large pieces had been
taken; and another from beneath a dolmen at Noes, in the island of
Falster, had a hole in it no less than two and a quarter by one and
three quarter inches in size. In the one case the holes were parts of a
wound to which the victim had succumbed; in the other the edges were
too regular to have been caused by traumatism. A Russian skull, a cast
of which has recently been presented to the Italian Anthropological
Society, bears traces of two trepanations; one performed during life,
the other after death. The former had evidently been caused neither by
illness nor by a wound.</p>
<p>General Faidherbe discovered at Roknia, in Algeria, two trepanned
skulls, dating from a remote antiquity, in one of which the wound is
half an inch in diameter, and shows no sign of cicatrization; and
travellers speak of evident traces of similar operations on skulls
dating from the time of the <span class="corr" id="xd21e5205" title=
"Source: Ainos">A&iuml;nos</span>, the ancestors or predecessors of the
Japanese at the present day; and if we cross the Atlantic, we shall
meet with instances <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5208" href=
"#xd21e5208" name="xd21e5208">267</a>]</span>of trepanations executed
in a similar manner, and probably for similar reasons.</p>
<p>We meet with numerous examples of trepanation in America, and fresh
discoveries are daily made by the energetic men of science in that
country. Dr. Mantegazza<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5212src" href=
"#xd21e5212" name="xd21e5212src">28</a> mentions three examples of
trepanation from Peru, which are of very great interest. One skull,
still bound up in many cloths, was found in the Sanja-Huara Cave
(province of Anta), which had been twice trepanned, and on which yet
two more attempts at trepanation bad been made. The latter seem to have
taken place at different times, and death seems to have succeeded the
last operation. Another skull which had belonged to an adult of
Huarocondo has two frontal openings close to each other; the upper, of
elliptical shape, is of large size and was evidently made after death.
Yet another skull from the province of Ollantay-tambo bears a double
trepanation, evidently made during life. The healing of the parietal
opening proves that it was made before the wound in the forehead, in
which the edges have remained rough. Dr. Mantegazza thinks that in the
two first cases the operations took place after the patient had been
wounded, but that in the third, the patient operated upon bad been
epileptic or perhaps even insane. We find it difficult to follow the
learned professor here, as we are ignorant of the grounds for his
conclusions.</p>
<p>We give an illustration (<a href="#fig081">Fig. 81</a>) of a
trepanned skull found in a cemetery in the Yucay valley. A square piece
has been cut out by making four regular incisions. The bone shows
traces of an ancient inflammation, and many eminent surgeons, including
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5222" href="#xd21e5222" name=
"xd21e5222">268</a>]</span>N&eacute;laton and Broca, have not hesitated
to attribute the opening, large as it is (seven by six inches), to a
surgical operation. If the incisions are carefully examined it is easy
to see that they were made with the help of a pointed instrument, such
as a clumsily made drill, for instance. Each incision must have taken a
long time to make, and we note with ever increasing astonishment that
the ancient Peruvians were not acquainted with the use of iron or
steel, and that the hardest metal they employed was bronze.</p>

<p class="first">Trepanned Peruvian skull.</p>
</div>
<p>A few years ago a sepulchre was opened at Chaclacayo, at the foot of
Mount Chosica, not far from Lima. In this tomb lay three mummies, of a
man, a woman, and a child. Near them lay a human skull, having about
the middle of the forehead an opening, measuring some two and a half by
two inches. It is of polygonal form, and eight different incisions can
easily be made out, which appear to have been made with some notched
stone implement. On raising a strip of skin, still adhering to the
skull, there was seen on the front part of the sagittal suture a very
small perforation, the result either of a wound or of an operation
which bad taken place during life. It has been suggested that the piece
of bone taken from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5231" href=
"#xd21e5231" name="xd21e5231">269</a>]</span>the skull had been used to
make a lance or arrow-head, which was superstitiously supposed by the
owner to ensure his victory. This is, however, a mere suggestion, of
which no proof can be given.</p>
<p>In other party of America discoveries have been made of trepanned
skulls, supposed to date from even more remote times than those we have
just been considering. A few years ago Professor Putnam found, in the
State of Ohio, some old wells idled with cinders and rubbish of all
kinds. From one of them, which was deeper than the others, he took
several crania, some of which bore evident traces of trepanation. From
a mound near Dallas (Illinois) were taken more than one hundred
skeletons, all of adults, placed side by side in a crouching attitude.
Every one of them had a round opening on the left temple, and in some
of these wounds the flint implement which had produced them was still
imbedded. It is very evident that we have here tokens of some funereal
rite, the meaning of which is uncertain, though it was evidently
practised also in districts very remote from Illinois. To mention yet
other examples, the excavation of a tumulus of irregular form near
Devil&rsquo;s River (Michigan) has brought to light five skeletons
buried u right, whilst a sixth lay in the centre of the tumulus, which
was evidently, if w e may so express it, the place of honor. On each of
the six crania a perforation had been made after death.</p>
<p>A number of crania and parts of crania on which trepanation had been
performed have also been taken from several mounds on Chamber&rsquo;s
Island, from beneath the mound in the neighborhood of the Sable River,
near Lake Huron, and near the Red River<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5237src" href="#xd21e5237" name="xd21e5237src">29</a> Gillman
thinks that the Michigan trepanations, which bad been made with clumsy
tools, were simply holes for hanging up skulls as trophies, as is still
customary amongst the Dyaks of Borneo; but this seems scarcely a
tenable hypothesis, for as a rule the skeletons lying in their last
home are complete. Quite recently were discovered, beneath a tumulus
near Rock River, eight skeletons, the skull of one of which bore a
circular perforation made during life, which rather upsets
Gillman&rsquo;s theory.</p>
<p>But to resume our narrative. The trepanations reported from North
America are generally posthumous, and we can prove nothing as to their
origin. Were they marks of honor made in some religious rite? Were they
openings to allow the spirit of the departed to revisit the body it had
abandoned? or, to suggest a far more worldly and revolting motive, were
they merely holes through which to pick out the brains of the dead. A
missionary, in a letter dated from Fort Pitt (Canada) in 1880,
describes the mode of scalping practised by the Redskins, and says that
they often take a round piece of skull as well as the scalp. May not
this be a case of atavism, or the transmission of a custom from one
generation to another, for the origin of which we must go back to the
most remote ages? In the present state of our knowledge, insufficient
as it is, this explanation is the most plausible.</p>
<p>It is even more difficult to come to a satisfactory conclusion with
regard to European examples of the practice we have been describing.
Trepanation was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5245" href=
"#xd21e5245" name="xd21e5245">271</a>]</span>certainly practised in the
treatment of certain diseases of the bone, such as osteitis or caries.
Professor Parrot mentions a case worth quoting.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5247src" href="#xd21e5247" name="xd21e5247src">30</a> A few years
ago several skeletons were found at Bray-sur-Seine (Seine-et-Marne)
with numerous objects, such as polished stone hatchets, bone stilettos,
shell necklaces and ornaments, all undoubtedly Neolithic. One of the
crania had been trepanned, the position of the operation showing that
its object had been to treat an osteitis. The operation had succeeded,
and the cicatrization of the bones, both about the wound and in the
parts originally affected, shows that recovery was complete. This is
the only example we have of an operation executed with a view to curing
a disease that can actually be seen, and it enables us to conclude that
these men, of whom we know so little, had some notion of surgery. Were
trepanations also practised to cure epilepsy or to heal mental
affections? From the earliest times the seat of these troubles was
always supposed to be the brain, and an ancient book of medicine
recommends as a remedy the scraping of the outside of the
skull.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5252src" href="#xd21e5252" name=
"xd21e5252src">31</a> In a recent book (&ldquo;<span lang="fr">De la
Tr&eacute;panation dans l&rsquo;&Eacute;pilepsie par le Traumatisme du
Cr&acirc;ne</span>&rdquo;), Echeverria mentions several cases of cure
by trepanation when epilepsy had been the result of an injury.
Observation may have led our prehistoric ancestors to discover this.
May we date this custom then from prehistoric times? It is very
difficult to decide with certainty either for or against it.</p>
<p>Of one thing, however, we may be quite certain. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5263" href="#xd21e5263" name=
"xd21e5263">272</a>]</span>The cranial perforations so much like one
another reported from districts so remote and different in character,
cannot be accidental. It is impossible to attribute to chance the
occurrence of injuries of exactly the same size in crania of totally
different origins. Setting aside the Entre-Roches skull, the antiquity
of which does not seem to us sufficiently established, we find this
custom maintained throughout the period characterized by the use of
polished stone weapons and implements, the erection of megalithic
monuments, and the domestication of animals. It was practised by the
men of the cave of <i lang="fr">L&rsquo;Homme Mort</i> at the beginning
of the Neolithic period, and was still in use at Moret when metals
began to be known. The discoveries of Dr. Wankel, the excavations of
the tumulus of Guisseny, prove that trepanation was continued
throughout the Bronze age, whilst the Jeuilly and Limet tombs show that
it was not discontinued even in Merovingian times.</p>
<p>The long continuance of such a practice is a very interesting fact,
and we may mention a yet more curious one. How are we to explain
trepanations that had no apparent motive on crania showing no symptoms
of disease? How account for the repetition at different tunes of this
operation, first on the living subject and then on the corpse, as at
St. Affrique, Bougon (<a href="#fig082">Fig. 82</a>), at Feigneux
(Oise), where Dr. Topinard has recently made excavations in a Neolithic
cave and reports that a dolichocephalic skull of the same type as the
crania of the cave of <i lang="fr">L&rsquo;Homme Mort</i>, belonging to
a man of about thirty years of age, bore two perforations, one made
during life, the other after death? The first measured two and a third
by two and a half <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5276" href=
"#xd21e5276" name="xd21e5276">273</a>]</span>inches, and was surrounded
by scratches, showing how clumsy the operator had been.<a class=

<p>In nearly every case the subjects operated on were young, and long
survived the operation. The knowledge of this fact was from the first a
very useful guide in the study of the subject of trepanation, and
eagerly pursued researches constantly confirm it. One skull, for
instance, from the cave of <i lang="fr">L&rsquo;Homme Mort</i>
(<a href="#fig083">Fig. 83</a>), had a large opening produced partly by
an old operation and partly by two posthumous trepanations. The subject
had been trepanned in childhood or early youth. There could be no doubt
on that point; cicatrization had been complete, the bony tissue having
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5296" href="#xd21e5296" name=
"xd21e5296">274</a>]</span>returned to its original condition. Then
after death, at an adult age, the relations or friends of the deceased
had cut out further round portions of the skull as near as possible to
the old wound, probably with a view to keeping these pieces as
amulets.</p>

</div>
<p>This was to Broca a flash of illuminating light, and according to
him was in some cases a religious rite, a ceremony of initiation,
perhaps even a custom inculcated by an established religion. The child
who had been subjected to it and had survived&mdash;as probably most of
the victims did survive,&mdash;attained to a certain position and
celebrity in his life, and after his death the fragments of his skull,
especially those portions near the old wound, became treasured relics,
and were in the end buried with their fortunate possessor on his death.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5305" href="#xd21e5305" name=
"xd21e5305">275</a>]</span></p>
<p>This superstition appears to have long survived even in historic
times, and a Gallic chain is quoted<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5308src"
href="#xd21e5308" name="xd21e5308src">33</a> on which hung a round
piece of skull with three holes in it. In. deed, these ornaments were
so much sought after that counterfeits of them were made; at least, we
cannot in any other way account for the occurrence of objects exactly
resembling round pieces of human crania, but in reality made out of
pieces of a stag&rsquo;s antler found in the Baumes-Chaudes Cave.</p>
<p>Yet another point deserves mention. It was evidently considered
undesirable that the crania from which pieces had been taken should be
left in a mutilated condition, and therefore pieces front other crania
were taken to fill up the gap, so that, says Broca,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e5316src" href="#xd21e5316" name="xd21e5316src">34</a> a new
life was evidently supposed to await the dead, for otherwise what
object can the restitution have served?</p>
<p>Dr. Pruni&egrave;res is also of opinion<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5323src" href="#xd21e5323" name="xd21e5323src">35</a> that the
introduction into the crania of certain deceased persons of round
pieces from other skulls implies the belief in another life. This
explanation, hypothetical as it is, is really very plausible, and it is
a pleasant thought that our remote ancestors had faith in a future
life; which faith is alike the greatest honor and the greatest comfort
of humanity. Is not yet another more striking proof of the belief in a
second existence to be found in the number of objects placed in tombs
at all periods of time and in every part of the world? It is this
belief, raising man as it does above the material needs of his
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5328" href="#xd21e5328" name=
"xd21e5328">276</a>]</span>daily life, which forms the true grandeur of
the human race, and if a nation once loses it it is sure to relapse
into barbarism.</p>
<p>When trepanning was the fashion there is no doubt that the operation
was performed in many different ways. Posthumous trepanations were
accomplished with the aid of a flint implement used as a chisel or a
saw. There was greater difficulty about an operation on a living
subject. Broca is of opinion that it was done with a drill turned round
and round in the skull in the way the French shepherds still treat
diseases of the crania in their sheep. The elliptical form of the wound
seemed to him to prove this, and he was further of opinion that when an
opening had been drilled in the skull at the point chosen, the
trepanation was completed by scraping the bone with a small flint
blade.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5332src" href="#xd21e5332" name=
"xd21e5332src">36</a> Discoveries made since the death of the great
French anthropologist, however, compel us to modify this opinion. The
inflammation of the bone noticed along the edges of the trepanation
proves that a notched implement was used to saw out the piece of
skull.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5337src" href="#xd21e5337" name=
"xd21e5337src">37</a></p>
<p>However the operation may have been performed, it is not one of
great danger to the patient or of great difficulty to the operator.
Experiments on animals with Quaternary flint implements have always
been successful, and have had no tragic results, which is the best
proof we can possibly give.</p>
<p>The size of the perforations made varies ad infinitum. One, the
largest known, is described which is no less than sixteen inches in
diameter.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5347src" href="#xd21e5347" name=
"xd21e5347src">38</a> Examples are <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e5352" href="#xd21e5352" name="xd21e5352">277</a>]</span>known of
the trepanation of every part of the skull, even of the forehead, which
at one time was supposed to have escaped. We have ourselves given
instances of frontal trepanation, and Dr. Pruni&egrave;res mentions
eleven cases in which the forehead had been operated on.</p>
<p>To conclude, we must repeat that trepanation is not really a
dangerous operation, and the reason it is nearly always followed by the
death of the subject in our own time is because it is never attempted
except in desperate cases, and the fatal result is really caused by the
cerebral disease, on account of which the operation was performed.
History tells us of its practice in very ancient times; Hippocrates
speaks of it as often resorted to by Greek physicians. It is performed
in the present day by the Negritos of Papua and the natives of
Australia and of some of the South Sea Islands, where it is considered
efficacious in many maladies. We also find it practised by the rough
miners of Cornwall and the wild mountaineers of Montenegro.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5356src" href="#xd21e5356" name=
"xd21e5356src">39</a> An army doctor who travelled in Montenegro a few
years ago said that it was no rare thing to meet men who had been
subjected to trepanation seven, eight, or even nine times. It is an
interesting question, though we must not enter into it here, whether
many races could stand such a number of operations as this.</p>
<p>The only instance we know in the present day of trepanation
practised as a religious rite, is met with among the Kabyles, who are
established at the foot of Mount Aur&egrave;s on the south of the
Atlas. The operation <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5370" href=
"#xd21e5370" name="xd21e5370">278</a>]</span>is performed among them by
the <i>th&eacute;bibe</i>, one of their priests, by the aid of a simple
gimlet which he turns rapidly round between his fingers. Among the
Kabyles are men who have submitted to an operation of this kind several
times.</p>
<p>We have now passed in review the weapons of prehistoric peoples, the
wounds they caused, and the modes of healing them known to our
ancestors; we have still to study the modes of defence resorted to by
them in face of the many dangers by which they were surrounded; but the
importance of this subject is such as to deserve separate
consideration. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5377" href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Combativeness, to use the language of phrenology, is
one of the most lively instincts of humanity. The Bible tells us of the
struggle between the sons of Adam, and shows us might making right ever
since the days of primeval man. History is but one long account of wars
and conquests, victories or defeats, and progress is chiefly marked in
inventions which made battles more sanguinary and added to the number
of victims slaughtered. At the very dawn of humanity man learned to
make weapons; very soon, however, weapons ceased to appear sufficient.
The first fortification was doubtless the cave, which its owner
strengthened by closing the entrance with blocks of stone and piles of
broken rock, or by digging deep trenches about it.</p>
<p>Population rapidly increased and war was declared between tribe and
tribe, nation and nation, race and race. Terrible must have been the
struggles between invaders and the original possessors of the soil.
Means of defence were multiplied to keep pace with new modes of attack,
and our ancestors of the Stone age were intelligent enough to make
places of refuge in which on necessity they could shelter their wives
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5388" href="#xd21e5388" name=
"xd21e5388">280</a>]</span>children, and later, when they became
sedentary, their flocks and their stores of grain. In many different
localities we find the remains of camps and fortifications, which, to
avoid using a more ambitious term, we may characterize generally as
enclosures.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5390src" href="#xd21e5390" name=
"xd21e5390src">1</a></p>
<p>These primitive enclosures, says Bertrand in his &ldquo;<span lang=
"fr">Arch&eacute;ologie Celtique et Gauloise</span>,&rdquo; may have
been very much more numerous than is supposed, if we include amongst
them, as it appears we ought, many ruins long thought to date from the
Roman era.</p>
<p>There is no doubt as to the purpose served by the camps, but we are
not prepared to speak as positively as does Bertrand as to their
origin, and the difficulty of deciding is very greatly increased on
account of these camps having been successively occupied at different
epochs by different peoples. Bearing in mind this reservation, we will
now sum up to the best of our ability all that is so far known about
the most important remains hitherto examined.</p>
<p>The residence of prehistoric man in the rich districts between the
Sambre and the Meuse is proved by worked flints, fragments of pottery,
and human bones dating from most remote times. The stations
successively occupied were situated near watercourses or copious
springs, and, where possible, on isolated escarped plateaux surrounded
by ravines. Hastedon, about a mile and a quarter from Namur, is one of
the best examples we <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5411" href=
"#xd21e5411" name="xd21e5411">281</a>]</span>can quote.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5413src" href="#xd21e5413" name="xd21e5413src">2</a>
The camp, first made out in 1865, formed a long square, covering some
thirteen hectares, or about thirty-two acres. It is situated on an
isolated mound connected with the main plateau by an isthmus 227 feet
long, and is protected on the south and west by a deep ravine: To these
natural defences men had added important works to those parts that were
accessible. The cutting of trenches a few years ago brought to light
walls of a mean thickness of more than nine feet, formed of masses of
rock and sand and round pieces of wood parallel with a
<i>rev&ecirc;tement</i> of dry stones surmounted by a palisade
consisting of three pieces of wood parallel with the walls, and seven
perpendicular traverses. All the wood was charred; the besieged had
evidently been driven out by fire. Excavations led to the finding of
Roman coins; this and the resemblance of the palisades to those
described by C&aelig;sar,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5421src" href=
"#xd21e5421" name="xd21e5421src">3</a> the very name of Hastedon, and
the tradition everywhere prevalent in the district, that this bad been
the site of a Gallic Roman camp, led to the general adoption of that
opinion. In fact, Napoleon III. actually ordered excavations to be made
in the hope of finding traces of the Atuatuques, one of the roost
warlike of the tribes of northern Gaul; but side by side with historic
relics were no less than ten thousand flints. These are chiefly merely
chips or nuclei which had served as hammers, or long thin slices, with
some few arrow- and lance-heads often skilfully cut, some polished
hatchets, and saws with fine teeth. Nearly all are notched and worn
with use, which does away with the idea that the place where they were
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5424" href="#xd21e5424" name=
"xd21e5424">282</a>]</span>found was the site of a workshop such as I
have already described. With these worked flints were found some
fragments of coarse pottery, which could not possibly be confounded
with Roman or Gallic work. The flints and pottery, and the walls put
together without cement, point to the conclusion that if the camp of
Hastedon was occupied by the Roman legions, it was long previous to
their day inhabited by some Neolithic race, ignorant of the use of any
but stone weapons and implements.</p>
<p>The camp of Pont-de-Bonn in the commune of Modave (Namur) very much
resembles in its arrangement that of Hastedon.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5428src" href="#xd21e5428" name="xd21e5428src">4</a> A mound
stands out upon the plain protected on the north and west by rocks
difficult of access and connected with the main plateau by a very
narrow tongue of land. Outside we can make out regular trenches
parallel with each other, and connected by a wall of masonry, at the
foot of which wall were picked up a good many iron nails. Inside the
<i>enceinte</i> itself worked flints were associated with Roman coins.
Are not these proofs in the first place of a long Neolithic occupation,
then of the residence of Gallic Romans, and yet later of even more
modern people of whom the masonry walls and iron nails are relics?</p>
<p>Limburg also contains some defensive works, many centuries old,
which are as yet but little known. We may mention amongst them the
so-called dyke of Zeedyck, near Tongres, a formidable intrenchment some
2,186 yards long by more than 325 feet wide at the base, and of a
height varying from 49 to 65 feet; the earthen ramparts of Willem on
the Geule, the not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5439" href=
"#xd21e5439" name="xd21e5439">283</a>]</span>less important ones of
Houlem, with many others far away from the great highways of
communication, but within the limits of the two provinces of
Li&egrave;ge and Limburg.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5441src" href=
"#xd21e5441" name="xd21e5441src">5</a></p>
<p>A few years ago Bertrand said that there are in France some four
hundred earthen <i>enceintes</i>, only sixty of which contain relics
connecting them with the Gallic Romans. Since Bertrand&rsquo;s
announcement this number has been greatly increased, thanks to eagerly
prosecuted local researches. De Pulligny mentions a hundred in Upper
Normandy<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5452src" href="#xd21e5452" name=
"xd21e5452src">6</a>; Martinet says they are very numerous in Berry;
one of the most remarkable, the quadrilateral of Haute-Brenne, covered
an area of nearly three thousand acres.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5457src" href="#xd21e5457" name="xd21e5457src">7</a> Amongst the
forests on the Vosges Mountains were discovered long single and double

Saverne.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5462src" href="#xd21e5462" name=
"xd21e5462src">8</a> At Rosmeur, on Penmarch Point (Finist&egrave;re),
Du Chatellier excavated two tumuli which appear to have been connected

promontory.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5471src" href="#xd21e5471" name=
"xd21e5471src">9</a> It would be merely fastidious to multiply
instances, we will content ourselves with describing a few of the most
interesting of these antique fortifications.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5477src" href="#xd21e5477" name="xd21e5477src">10</a></p>
<p>The camp of Chassey (Sa&ocirc;ne-et-Loire) may be compared with
those of Belgium. It is situated on a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e5485" href="#xd21e5485" name="xd21e5485">284</a>]</span>plateau
2,440 feet long by a width varying from 360 to 672 feet. A huge natural
rocky barrier rises on the south and east, whilst on the northeast and
southwest we find two important intrenchments made of huge blocks of
stone with a <i>rev&ecirc;tement</i> of earth. One of these
intrenchments is 45, the other only 29 feet high. There is no trace
inside of springs, and the inhabitants must always have had to obtain
their water-supply by artificial means. The cisterns now in this camp
appear to have been dug out with iron implements, and are certainly of
later date than the first occupation of the plateau. Numerous objects
picked up in the Chassey Camp belong to Neolithic times, but the people
who have occupied it since those remote days, the men of the Bronze and
Iron ages, the Gauls, the Romans, and the Merovingians, have so turned
over the ground that products of industries, completely strange to each
other, are everywhere mixed together in inextricable
confusion.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5490src" href="#xd21e5490" name=
"xd21e5490src">11</a></p>
<p>There were originally a good many hearths about the camp, and it was
near to one of them that the spoon was found, figured in an earlier
chapter of this book (<a href="#fig025">Fig. 25</a>). With it were
picked up polished fibrolite, basalt, chloromelanite, serpentine, and
diorite hatchets; evidently made in the neighborhood, as is proved
beyond a doubt by the numerous chips and partly worked pieces lying
about, as well as the discovery of no less than thirty polishers, many
of them showing signs of long service. Bone implements <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5518" href="#xd21e5518" name=
"xd21e5518">285</a>]</span>of all kinds and whistles made of the
phalanges of oxen are also constantly found. Even if the presence of
these objects does not enable us to come to any final conclusion, they
are at least most useful and interesting in enabling us to put together
little by little a picture of the life of the most ancient inhabitants
of France.</p>
<p>The camp of Catenoy, Dear Liancourt (Oise) is arranged very much in
the same manner as that of Chassey.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5522src"
href="#xd21e5522" name="xd21e5522src">12</a> <i>C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s
Camp</i>, as it is called by the people of the neighborhood, forms a
long triangle, the apex of which rests on the eastern extremity of the
plateau. Excavations have yielded a number of Gallic-Roman objects,
with some polished hatchets, some broken, others intact, with stone and
bone weapons, resembling but for a few slight differences those we have
described so often. Numerous fragments of pottery were also picked up,
which pottery, hand-made and mixed with crushed shells, seldom has
either handles or any attempt at ornamentation. Weapons, implements,
and pottery are all alike totally different from any Roman or Gallic
work known. It is impossible to study the relics at Catenoy without
coming to the conclusion that the camp was occupied at periods prior to
Gallic and Roman times, and that there, as in many other districts, the
Latin conquerors had succeeded an unknown vanquished race.</p>
<p>De Quatrefages has accurately made out a series of works extending
along the left bank of the Nive, as far as Itsassou, and of which the
Pas-de-Roland marks the extreme limit. A merely superficial examination
is enough to show that these defences existed only on the side to which
access would otherwise have been <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e5533" href="#xd21e5533" name="xd21e5533">286</a>]</span>easy,
while the height overlooking the river on the other side, which is
impregnable by nature, has been left untouched. Here too we find the
name C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s Camp given to the relics, a fact of common
occurrence all over France, where the great captain was long held in
honor. Quatrefages is, however, of opinion that the works are neither
Roman, Gallic nor Celtic, and he even arrives by a process of
elimination at the conclusion that they were erected by the Iberians,
who preceded the Aryans, and have left so deep an impress on all the
countries they successively occupied. We do not feel able to accept
entirely this hypothesis; but no suggestion of the eminent professor
must be overlooked by those who earnestly seek with unbiassed minds to
ascertain the truth.</p>
<p>Gregory of Tours relates that at the time of the invasion of the
Vandals, the Gabali took refuge with their families in the <i>Castrum
Gredonense</i>, and there, for two years, energetically resisted the
invaders.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5540src" href="#xd21e5540" name=
"xd21e5540src">13</a> Gr&egrave;ze, now a little market town of the
department of Loz&egrave;re, is the <i>castrum</i> of which the old
French chronicler speaks, and Dr. Pruni&egrave;res there collected
forty stone hatchets, differing in no material respect from others
found in such numbers elsewhere, with flint knives and scrapers, bone
stilettos, and millstones, doubtless used for grinding grain, all of
which are to the learned French professor proofs of the existence there
of a Neolithic station before the historic period.</p>
<p>In the department of Alpes-Maritimes a series of defensive works
crown the circle of mountains which rise from the shores of the
Mediterranean. These intrenchments certainly date from a remote period,
though <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5548" href="#xd21e5548" name=
"xd21e5548">287</a>]</span>we cannot assign them to any definite time,
and the fact that they have been repaired at different epochs proves
that they were successively occupied.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5550src" href="#xd21e5550" name="xd21e5550src">14</a> They
consist principally of circular or elliptical <i>enceintes</i>
surrounded by walls of stones without mortar, and they vary in diameter
from some 39 to 328 feet. One of the largest is that on the Colline des
Mulets, above Monte Carlo.</p>

<p>Although the pile-dwellings of Switzerland and of the
<i>terremares</i> of Italy would appear to have been in themselves
protection enough, their inhabitants did not neglect other means of
defence, from which we may gather that they were engaged in constant
and terrible struggles. The <i>terremares</i> were generally surrounded
by a talus or rampart of earth, with an external fosse which protected
the approaches to the dwellings. The rampart of Castione (Parma), which
dates from the Bronze age, was even strengthened inside with large
timber caissons.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5578src" href="#xd21e5578"
name="xd21e5578src">15</a> In Switzerland, some works recently
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5584" href="#xd21e5584" name=
"xd21e5584">288</a>]</span>undertaken to deflect the course of the Aar,
on its exit from Lake Bienne, have led to the discovery of a village of
the Stone age, with the bridges leading to it and the little forts
intended to protect it.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5586src" href=
"#xd21e5586" name="xd21e5586src">16</a> As have the neighboring
settlements, this station has yielded a great many arrows, hatchets,
scrapers, and harpoons. We give an illustration of a curious marrow
spoon, and of a round object which seems to have been a button
(<a href="#fig084">Fig. 84</a>), as they mark the progress made.</p>
<p>Great Britain is intersected by lines of fortifications of unknown
origin, but certainly of extreme antiquity. We may mention Dane&rsquo;s
Dyke, Wandyke, the Devil&rsquo;s Dyke at Newmarket, and Offa&rsquo;s
Dyke, running from the Bristol Channel to the Dee, and dividing England
from Wales. Ancient camps and intrenchments, Sir John Lubbock tells us,
crown the greater number of the hills of England. General Pitt-Rivers
explored several of these camps in the county of Sussex. Many extend
over considerable areas, and all contain numerous worked flints and
other relics of prehistoric industry. These relics are met with in
great numbers at the base of the intrenchments, so that we may justly
conclude that they date from the same epoch.</p>
<p>The most celebrated of these camps is that of Cissbury, three miles
north of Worthing. We may also mention that of Hod-Hill in Dorsetshire,
which greatly resembles the one at Cissbury, but we will describe the
latter in some detail.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5599src" href=
"#xd21e5599" name="xd21e5599src">17</a> It is situated on a somewhat
lofty plateau of irregular form, its site having been chosen with great
skill as one offering great facilities for defence. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5608" href="#xd21e5608" name=
"xd21e5608">289</a>]</span>The earthen ramparts and the fosses
protecting them cover an area of sixty acres, and their importance
varies according to the relief of the ground; thus the thickness of the
walls is very much greater on the eastern side where an attack would
have been most fraught with danger; four doors give access to the
interior, and on each side of these doors are ruins of rectangular
structures strengthening their defence. Arch&aelig;ologists, however,
are of opinion that these redoubts, though their construction is
exactly similar to the rest of the fortifications, are of more recent
date. In fact Roman tiles have been found amongst the ruins, but these
really prove nothing, as every one is agreed that Cissbury was occupied
by the Romans after the subjugation of England by them; and the only
point at issue is really whether the walls of which the ruins still
remain date from the Roman period, or from times prior to their
arrival. We ourselves lean to the latter opinion, as drinking-water is
absolutely wanting; a very important point, as the Roman generals
always made it their first care to pitch their camps near a good
water-supply. On the western slope at Cissbury on each side of the
ramparts are fifty funnel-shaped depressions, some of which are as much
as seventy feet in diameter and twelve feet deep. These holes may have
served as refuges, and the larger ones were certainly lived in, as is
proved by the charred stones of the hearths and the pieces of charcoal
found near them; moreover, Tacitus<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5610src"
href="#xd21e5610" name="xd21e5610src">18</a> tells us that the Germans
lived in similar habitations. Whatever, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e5619" href="#xd21e5619" name="xd21e5619">290</a>]</span>however,
may have been their ultimate use, these hollows were in the first place
dug out with a view to obtaining flints in the marly chalk forming the
bill; and recent excavations have revealed the existence of galleries
connecting the depressions. When they became later human habitations
some of the inside openings were blocked up with lumps of chalk,
carefully piled up so as to make entrance extremely difficult, greatly
adding to the security of the inmates.</p>
<p>Thirty of these shafts were excavated in succession; and amongst the
rubbish of all kinds with which they were filled were found some well
cut celts, showing no trace of polish, and some weapons or tools of the
Moust&eacute;rien type. The number of half-finished implements, and the
even greater quantity of chips, points to these shafts having formed a
centre of manufacture. Many of the implements were made of stag-horn,
and amongst them we must mention some picks which, curiously enough,
exactly resemble those of Belgium and the south of France.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5623src" href="#xd21e5623" name=
"xd21e5623src">19</a> Similar wooden picks are found in the copper
mines of the Asturias, in the salt mines of Salzburg, and in a
petroleum well recently opened on the frontier between the United
States and Canada. In all these localities traces can be made out of
ancient mining operations. But to return to Cissbury: from amongst the
prehistoric ruins there were also taken, numerous fragments of pottery,
not at all like Roman ware, with the bones of the horse, goat, boar,
and ox, all still represented in the fauna of England; with
oyster-shells, and the shells of both land and sea mollusca, of species
still to be found in Great Britain. But no trace has so far been
discovered of metals, and neither the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e5628" href="#xd21e5628" name="xd21e5628">291</a>]</span>flint
implements nor the bones of animals have any of the marks of rust so
characteristic of the Bronze and Iron ages. Must we not then conclude
that these shafts were sunk at a time long prior to the earliest
historic period?</p>
<p>The walls of the subterranean galleries of Cissbury bore not only
cup-shaped ornaments, strive, and curved or broken lines, recalling
those on the megalithic monuments of Scotland and Ireland; but Park
Harrison has made out some regular <i>runes</i>, or written characters,
of which a reproduction was shown at the Paris Exhibition in 1878. This
last fact is the more curious, as Sayce discovered in a passage giving
access to a cave near Syracuse some characters somewhat similar in
form, to which he assigns a proto-Ph&oelig;nician origin. We may add
that certain characters made out at Cissbury, differing but little from
the modern letter <i>b</i> or the figure 6, are also found in the most
ancient Palmyrian, Copt, and Syrian alphabets. Were this fact
completely established, still more, if it were corroborated by other
analogous facts, we should in it have a very valuable indication of the
relations of England with the most ancient known navigators.</p>
<p>Germany also contains some ancient fortifications, of which the most
remarkable are the <i>Heidenmauer</i> of Saint Odila, near Hermeskiel,
between the Moselle and the Rhine. Huge stones, piled up without
cement, form a triple <i>enceinte</i>, but there is nothing to connect
these remains with prehistoric times. It is the same with the
intrenchments in the Grand Duchy of Posen, the existence of which was
announced at a meeting of the Anthropological Society of
Berlin.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5647src" href="#xd21e5647" name=
"xd21e5647src">20</a> Many <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5652"
href="#xd21e5652" name="xd21e5652">292</a>]</span>of these defensive
works, notably those of Potzrow and of Zabnow, bad been erected on
piles. In the district between Thorn and the Baltic are numerous mounds
of the shape of a truncated cone, the platform of which is surrounded
by an embankment some 590 feet in diameter.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5654src" href="#xd21e5654" name="xd21e5654src">21</a> Near many
of these were picked up many broken human bones, mixed together in the
greatest confusion with weapon, hatchets, and hammers, resembling
Neolithic types. Everything bears witness to the struggles of which
these mounds were the scene.</p>
<p>Similar relies of a past still obscure are met with in the south of
Europe. Cartailhac has brought into notice the <i>citanias</i>, which
are strange fortified towns in Portugal. On the plateau of
Mouinho-da-Moura, southwest of Lisbon, were found numerous polished
hatchets, associated with shells of marine mollusca and the bones of
mammals belonging to species still extant.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5665src" href="#xd21e5665" name="xd21e5665src">22</a> This
station was protected by intrenchments of so great an extent that it
has been impossible to examine the whole of them. There are also near
the same place several caves, now nearly choked up. One of them was
originally a regular tunnel; the cutting leading to the entrance was
made of earth and small stones; it contained the bones of animals, some
cinders, and four large vases of coarse workmanship. It is difficult to
make out what this cave was used for, the great confusion in which the
bones lay excluding all idea of its having been a tomb. Ribeiro had
already made out at Lycea an intrenched camp protected <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5671" href="#xd21e5671" name=
"xd21e5671">294</a>]</span>by clumsily constructed walls. Inside the
<i>enceinte</i> he picked up numerous fragments of ornamented pottery,
with polished hatchets, shells, and a good many bones of animals. He
also made out several sepulchres.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5676src"

</div>
<p>The prehistoric station of <i>La Muela de Chert</i> in Maeztrago
reminds us of those of Portugal. It is situated on a little eminence,
protected on the north and east by the natural escarpment of the
plateau, and on other sides by a wall of some height made of stones
without mortar. Some foundations of an oval shape, on which doubtless
were built the homes of the inhabitants, can be made out in the middle
of the <i>enceinte</i>. We can, however, but repeat here what we have
said so often elsewhere, that it is impossible to fix the exact date at
which these intrenchments were made. The discovery, however, of
polished flint hatchets, diorite lance-heads, and a few bones of
ruminants and cervi&aelig; unknown in Spain in prehistoric times, would
appear to point to a very considerable antiquity. Lastly, two young
Belgian engineers<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5692src" href="#xd21e5692"
name="xd21e5692src">24</a> have lately made out between Almeria and
Carthagena a considerable number of prehistoric stations in which can
be traced successively the different Stone ages and those of Copper and
of Bronze. Several of these stations (<a href="#fig085">Fig. 85</a>)
are regular fortified camps, protected by thick stone walls cemented
with a thin layer of clay. The fire which destroyed the habitations has
left behind, beneath the ashes and cinders, numerous objects, with the
aid of which we are able to form a picture of the life led by the men
who built the fortifications, and we know that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5701" href="#xd21e5701" name=
"xd21e5701">295</a>]</span>they were agriculturists, for the very
stores of grain have been found charred and agglutinated by fire. In
the more recent stations flint, which was in the earliest time the one
material used, has disappeared and is replaced by the copper, of which
a plentiful supply was found in the rich mines riddling the mountains.
Excavations have even brought to light the workshop of the
metallurgist, with its moulds and vases converted into crucibles, its
essays at new forms, its scoriae, and lastly its finished weapons,
showing real skill in their production.</p>
<p>Although it is impossible to assign to them a definite date, we
must, to make this part of our work complete, say a few words on the
earthworks met with in Roumania. A former minister of that
principality, M. Odobesco,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5705src" href=
"#xd21e5705" name="xd21e5705src">25</a> classes them as <i>valla,
tumuli</i>, and <i>cetati de pamentu</i> or citadels.</p>
<p>The <i>valla</i> include important works. One of them cuts across
Valachie parallel with the Danube and loses itself in Southern Russia.
Another crosses the north of Moldavia and Bessarabia, following a
direction convergent with the former. These <i>valla</i>, although they
are known in the country in which they occur as <i>Foss&eacute;s de
Trajan</i>, are certainly of earlier date than the Roman occupation,
and in fact Roman roads cut across the intrenchments or fosses which
have been levelled or covered over to make way for them. Excavations of
the large tumuli are not yet sufficiently advanced for us to hazard an
opinion about them. The smaller ones, however, are seldom of Roman
origin. The funeral vases of calcareous stone which they contain bear
witness clearly enough <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5727" href=
"#xd21e5727" name="xd21e5727">296</a>]</span>to their destination, and
also to the rite with which they were connected.</p>
<p>The <i>cetati de pamentu</i> are regular earthen fortifications set
up within short distances of each other on all the heights overlooking
the torrential rivers of Roumania. These intrenchments, generally of
round or oval form, are protected by deep fosses, parapets, and
palisades. Masses of cinders and burnt earth bear unmistakable evidence
to the cause of their destruction. All about, excavations have brought
to light coarse pottery, grindstones for crushing grain, stores of
millet which had been damaged by the flames, and a few primitively
constructed bronze idols. When the vanquished Roumanians were driven
from their intrenchments, they had evidently learned to use bronze, but
were still, as we have already remarked, unacquainted with iron, as no
object in that material has been found, nor does anything bear any
trace of rust.</p>
<p>Thus, throughout Europe, man, in the presence of the many dangers
surrounding him, endeavored in the very earliest times to protect by
similar means his family, his flocks, and his wealth. In America we are
able to quote facts of even more importance. The vast territory
comprised between the Alleghanies and the Rocky Mountains, between the
great lakes of Canada and the Gulf of Mexico, is intersected with truly
colossal fortifications, almost all of them made entirely of earth. The
ancient Americans knew how to protect every height and every delta
formed by the junction of two rivers with redoubts, walls, parapets,
fosses, and circumvallations. Not without astonishment we make out a
regular system of fortresses connected with each other by deep trenches
and secret <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5736" href="#xd21e5736"
name="xd21e5736">297</a>]</span>passages, some of them hewn out beneath
the beds of rivers, observatories on the heights, and concentric walls,
some actually strengthened with casemates protecting the entrances. All
these works were constructed by the so-called Mound-Builders, of whose
ancestors or of whose descendants absolutely nothing is known.</p>
<p>All the strongholds of the Mound-Builders rise near abundant
watercourses, and the best proof that can be given of the intelligence
which guided their constructors in their choice of sites, is the fact
of the number of flourishing cities such as Newark, Portsmouth,
Cincinnati, Saint Louis, Frankfort, and New-Madrid, etc., which were
built upon the ruins of various earthworks.</p>
<p>It would take us too long merely to enumerate all the ancient
fortifications still existing in North America. Moreover they all
resemble each other so much that the description of a few of them is
really all that is needed to prove their importance.</p>
<p>Fort Hill (<a href="#fig005">Fig. 5, p. 39</a>) rises from an
eminence overlooking a little river called Paint Creek; the walls vary
in height from eight to fifteen feet, and exceed thirty feet in
thickness.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5747src" href="#xd21e5747" name=
"xd21e5747src">26</a> Several doors facilitate entrance, and one of
them leads to a square <i>enciente</i>, the walls of which have been
almost entirely destroyed. This enclosure probably contained the homes
of the people, which may have been mere cabins of adobes or sun-burnt
bricks, or huts covered with rushes, interlaced branches, or the skins
of animals; on this point we are reduced to guesswork. In the centre of
the principal enclosure can be made out, in almost every <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5753" href="#xd21e5753" name=
"xd21e5753">298</a>]</span>case, several much smaller enclosures, each
containing in their turn one or more mounds. Some think these were
consecrated to religious rites, but this is a mere conjecture, for
nothing is really known of the form of government or of the religion of
the Mound-Builders.</p>
<p>Forest trees have grown up on these abandoned ruins, succeeding
other vegetable growths; the huge girth of the decaying trunks proving
their longevity. Man, impelled by motives we cannot fathom, had
abandoned the districts where everything bears witness to his power and
intelligence, and the vigorous vegetation of nature once more has it
all its own way.</p>
<p>The most remarkable group of prehistoric fortifications in North
America is perhaps that near Newark, in the valley of the Scioto. It
includes an octagonal <i>enceinte</i> eighty acres in area, a square
<i>enceinte</i> of twenty acres, with two others, one twenty the other
thirty acres in extent. The walls of the great circle are still twelve
feet high by fifty feet wide at the base. They are protected by an
interior fosse seven feet deep by thirty-five feet wide. According to
measurements carefully made by Colonel Whittlesey,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e5766src" href="#xd21e5766" name="xd21e5766src">27</a> the
total area covered by these intrenchments is no less than twelve square
miles, and the length of the mounds exceeds two miles. The large
entrances protected by mounds thirty-five feet high, the avenues
leading to them which are regular labyrinths, the quaintly shaped
mounds&mdash;one, for instance, represents the foot of a gigantic
bird&mdash;all combine to strike the visitor with astonishment. We give
a representation (<a href="#fig086">Fig. 86</a>) of a group, not unlike
that we have just described, which is situated at Liberty (Ohio), and
includes two circles and one <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5772"
href="#xd21e5772" name="xd21e5772">299</a>]</span>square. The diameter
of the great circle is 1,700 feet, and it encloses an area of forty
acres, whilst that of the smaller <i>enceinte is 500</i> feet; the area
of the square, each side of which measures 1,080 feet, is twenty-seven
acres. The walls are not strengthened by any ditch, and, contrary to
general usage, the earth of which they are made was dug out from the
inside of the <i>enciente</i> itself. We may also mention Old Fort
(Greenup County, Kentucky), successively described by Caleb Atwater,
Squier, and J. H. Lewis. It is situated forty feet above the river, and
the total length of the walls exceeds 3,175 feet. Six entrances give
access to it, and in the centre rises a mound representing some animal,
a bear probably, measuring more than 105 feet. Several small mounds,
beneath which were found human bones, cluster about the larger one.</p>

<p class="first">Trenches at Juigalpa (Nicaragua).</p>
</div>
<p>We must not omit to name an extraordinary system of intrenchments at
Juigalpa, in Nicaragua, which so far as I know is quite unique. This is
a series of trenches extending for several miles (<a href=
"#fig087">Fig. 87</a>), varying in width from nine and a half to
thirteen feet; at equal distances are oval reservoirs, the longest axis
of which measures as much as seventy-eight feet. In each reservoir are
two or four mounds, probably serving as watch-towers. We know nothing
either of the people who erected these singular structures or of the
enemy from whom they formed a protection. Nor can anything be guessed
as to the way in which the defence was conducted. All is involved in
obscurity, and at every turn we are compelled to repeat that
prehistoric studies are weighted with uncertainty, long and arduous
study being necessary to bring ever so little order into the chaos in
which everything connected with them is involved.</p>
<p>We must cursorily refer to some other fortifications which really
scarcely belong to our subject, though certain arch&aelig;ologists
claim for them a prehistoric origin. We refer to the vitrified forts,
which are strange structures in which stones, such as granite and
gneiss, quartzite and basalt, have been subjected to a heat so intense
as to produce vitrification.</p>
<p>These vitrified forts are <i>enceintes</i>, generally of round or
elliptical form, carefully erected where they were most needed for
defence, and protected by one or more <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e5805" href="#xd21e5805" name=
"xd21e5805">301</a>]</span>ramparts.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5807src" href="#xd21e5807" name="xd21e5807src">28</a> The
ramparts all bear traces of vitrification, more or less complete, which
has, so to speak, cemented them together. The vitrification is very
unequal, being complete in some parts and scarcely noticeable in
others. It is evident that the builders did not know how to direct
their fire uniformly.</p>
<p>Ever since 1777 vitrified forts have been known in Scotland, and
until 1837 they were supposed to exist nowhere else. About that time,
however, Professor Zippe called attention to similar ruins in Bohemia,
and later it was announced that discoveries of the same kind had been
made in various parts of France, Denmark, and Norway. Virchow speaks of
the <i>Schlaken W&auml;lle</i>, or ramparts of vitrified scoria, near
Kern<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5818src" href="#xd21e5818" name=
"xd21e5818src">29</a> and Schaafhausen, and gave an account of them at
a meeting of German naturalists at Ratisbon. It would be easy to
multiply instances. Vitrified walls are known in the Puy-de-D&ocirc;me,
in which the facing is of clay, and draught flues, for regulating and
fanning the flames, have been made out. At Castel-Sarrazin is a camp
refuge with similar dispositions,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5823src"
href="#xd21e5823" name="xd21e5823src">30</a> and recently Daubree
presented to the <span lang="fr">Acad&eacute;mie des Sciences</span> a
piece of porphyry artificially vitrified from the prehistoric
<i>enceinte</i> of Hartmannswiller Kopf in Upper Alsace.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5839src" href="#xd21e5839" name=
"xd21e5839src">31</a></p>
<p>It is in Scotland, however, that are situated the most remarkable
vitrified forts. A few years ago no less than forty-four were counted.
The most celebrated are those of Barry Hill and Castle Spynie in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5846" href="#xd21e5846" name=
"xd21e5846">302</a>]</span>Invernesshire, Top-O-Noth in Aberdeen, and a
small fort which rises from a lofty rock in the midst of the Strait of
Bute. Vitrified cairns also occur in the Orkney Islands, notably on the
little isle of Sanday, but the most interesting structures of the kind
are Craig Ph&oelig;drick and Ord Hill of Kissock, which rise up like
huge pillars on the hills at the entrance of Moray Firth, at a distance
of three miles from each other.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5848src"
href="#xd21e5848" name="xd21e5848src">32</a></p>
<p>Craig Ph&oelig;drick is now covered with a luxuriant vegetation of
broom, furze, and fern, with groves of firs and larches, amongst which
the explorer makes his way with difficulty to the fortifications, or
rather to the piles of massive blocks to which that name has been
given. These blocks form an acropolis of oval form, the upper part of
which is a flat terrace encircling a central basin some six and a half
to nine and a half feet deep, which may be compared to the craters of
the extinct volcanoes of Auvergne. The sides of the mound are strewn
with cyclopean blocks of vitrified granite, which evidently originally
formed part of the fortifications. It is on the eastern side,
overlooking the valley of the Ness, that the buildings are of the
greatest importance; two terraces can be made out, the lower projecting
beyond the upper, forming a double series of almost perpendicular
fortifications, constructed of vitrified blocks cemented together with
thin layers of mortar, spread without any attempt at regularity. The
blocks form, with the mortar, a conglomerate so compact that when
struck with a hammer they break without separating. Examination of
fragments under the microscope prove that they have gone <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5859" href="#xd21e5859" name=
"xd21e5859">303</a>]</span>through important mineralogical
transformations, under the influence of what must have been an
extremely high temperature. The heat must have been indeed intense
which could cause mica to disappear entirely, and feldspar to melt
almost completely.</p>
<p>The hill known as Ord Hill of Kissock is crowned, as is Craig
Ph&oelig;drick, with ruins still standing, but the vegetation about
them is so dense and thorny that it is difficult to make out the
condition of the remains. The ruins, which can only be seen from one
side, appear however to have formed part of fortifications, dating from
the same time and serving the same purpose as those of Craig
Ph&oelig;drick. Were they forts? There is certainly no sign of their
having been used as habitations. Or were they, as some
arch&aelig;ologists are disposed to think, beacon houses used for
warning the people of the approach of the Norman pirates or
Scandinavian Vikings, whose depredations were not discontinued until
the eighth century of the Christian era? Hypotheses are always easy,
but proofs of these hypotheses are difficult to find, and we confess we
have none to bring forward.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5863src" href=
"#xd21e5863" name="xd21e5863src">33</a></p>
<p>Passing to France, we find the greater number of vitrified forts in
the D&eacute;partement de la Creuse. At Ch&acirc;teauvieux is an
<i>enceinte</i> of oval form, 416 feet wide at its broadest
part.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5872src" href="#xd21e5872" name=
"xd21e5872src">34</a> An earthwork, 22 feet <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5881" href="#xd21e5881" name=
"xd21e5881">304</a>]</span>wide at the base, serves as foundation to a
wall, the outer and inner portions of which consist of small granite
stones, arranged in regular layers. The space between the two series of
small stones is filled in with a sheet of melted granite, some
twenty-four inches wide, resting on calcareous tufa. The whole mass is
completely vitrified, and regular geodes or nodules lined with crystals
and draped with pendent drops of melted rock have been produced.</p>
<p>The ancient fortress of Ribandelle, of circular form, rises above
the Creuse, opposite Ch&acirc;teauvieux. It was successively occupied
by the Celts, the Romans, and the Visigoths, but we are unable to fix
the date of its erection or the name of the people who built it. There
remain but a few ruins at the present day, but we can make out in them
the same mode of construction as that followed at Ch&acirc;teauvieux.
The walls are faced with unhewn stones, the outer side of which still
retains a natural appearance, while the inner is corroded and
disintegrated. In the wall itself, separated from the facings by beds
of peat mould, are great blocks of vitrified granite. The traces of the
action of fire are specially noticeable in the upper part of the walls,
so that they were evidently finished when the fusion took place.</p>
<p>The site of the furnace in these forts is difficult to determine. It
was evidently not situated under any of the blocks, for the earthworks
on which they rest retain no traces of the action of fire. Nor was it
situated at the side, for the outer facings have retained alike their
original form and consistency. Nor can the furnace have been lit on the
blocks, as heat exercises its action by radiating in every direction.
We <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5887" href="#xd21e5887" name=
"xd21e5887">305</a>]</span>are therefore forced to the conclusion that
the fire was spread with the aid of spaces left in the inside of the
construction at various points, for the vitrified mass is divided into
blocks, about nine and three fourths feet long, at very short distances
from each other.</p>
<p>These few examples will be enough to give some idea of the strange
vitrified forts. Many of them retain traces of Roman occupation. The
Gu&eacute;ret Museum possesses a fragment from the Ribandelle walls in
which a Roman tile is completely imbedded; and M. Thuot picked up other
tiles in a similar condition amongst the ruins. This is a very decided
proof that the vitrification took place after the arrival of the
conquerors of Gaul. The weapons and tools discovered would appear to
confirm this idea, and to suggest similar explanations of vitrification
elsewhere. If so, we shall have to admit that vitrified forts date from
the earliest centuries of the Christian era, and are not prehistoric at
all. We have, however, noticed them here on account of the grave doubts
in the matter, and because they furnish a striking and valuable
illustration of the relations existing from the most remote tunes
between widely separated races, and maintained until the present time.
In no other way can we account for the practice of the extremely
difficult and complicated operation of the vitrification of bard rocks
in districts so far apart as Norway and Scotland, Germany and the
midlands of France.</p>
<p>The more we think of the difficulties vitrification presents, the
greater is our astonishment. How was the fusion achieved of elements so
refractory alike in their structure and in the resistance offered by
accumulated masses of material? By what processes was heat <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5893" href="#xd21e5893" name=
"xd21e5893">306</a>]</span>brought up to the 1300 degrees necessary for
the fusion of granite? The incineration and fusion of the materials of
which the vitrified forts are made, especially the granite ones of La
Creuse and the C&ocirc;tes du Nord, bear witness, says Daubr&eacute;e,
to a surprising skill and knowledge of the management of fire in those
who burned them, but these qualities were manifested also in extremely
ancient metallurgical operations. It is quite impossible to suppose the
vitrification to have been the result of a conflagration. No fire,
whether accidental or the work of an incendiary, could be powerful
enough to produce such results. The use of petroleum in the most
terrible conflagrations of our own time&mdash;those of the Commune in
1871, for instance&mdash;did calcine and disintegrate stone, but I know
of no case of vitrification.</p>
<p>The Keramic Museum of S&egrave;vres contains several specimens which
present very notable differences to each other. Those from
Ch&acirc;teau-Gontier are formed of very close-grained quartzite
granite of a greenish color streaked with black. The conglomerate
welding there together is a vitrified scoria full of very small bubbles
made by the escape of gas which had not had sufficient strength to get
out. The block from Sainte-Suzanne (Mayenne) consists of quartz mixed
with half calcined grains of feldspar, bleached by the action of fused
glass, which once introduced filled up as it congealed all the vacant
spaces with a vitreous substance of light greenish-white color. The
fractures are green and bright, and are dotted with white points, which
are all that is left of the stones after their disintegration in the
grip of a heat that was alike intense and rapid in its action. The
fragments brought from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5897" href=
"#xd21e5897" name="xd21e5897">307</a>]</span>Scotland differ from those
just described. They consist of small pieces of granite completely
merged in a thick paste with which they form the mass, the whole
breaking together when it does break; and the melted matter seldom has
any bubbles in it.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5899src" href=
"#xd21e5899" name="xd21e5899src">35</a></p>
<p>The process employed in cementing the materials of the vitrified
forts was then perfectly unique. The processes employed to obtain the
necessary heat varied according to circumstances and according to the
nature of the materials used. At Sainte-Suzanne and at La Courbe marine
salt was used as a flux. Captain Pr&eacute;vot<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5907src" href="#xd21e5907" name="xd21e5907src">36</a> thinks that
the walls were smeared with a coating of clay, and that as in the
baking of bricks spaces were left between so as to produce more intense
heat. M. de Montaiglon is of opinion that the buildings were in the
first instance erected without the use of any calcareous or
argillaceous material, and that glass in a state of fusion was poured
over them afterwards, this glass consolidating them and forming with
them one indestructible mass. M. Thuot seems much disposed to share
this last opinion, but he thinks that some chemical materials such as
soda or potash were also used. Yet one other possible solution may be
mentioned, a solution which is becoming more and more generally
accepted, namely that the granite was not after all really melted, but
that the vitrification should either be attributed to the fusion of the
argillaceous mass, which has been subjected to an igneous
transformation, such as that which often takes place in furnaces for
baking bricks and in lime-kilns.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5912src"
href="#xd21e5912" name="xd21e5912src">37</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5917" href="#xd21e5917" name=
"xd21e5917">308</a>]</span></p>
<p>Whatever explanation we may accept, however, the processes employed
certainly bear witness to a much more advanced state of civilization
than was acquired in the earliest ages of humanity. We have been led by
the great interest and mystery of the subject to dwell longer on it
than we intended, and we must hasten to return to prehistoric times
with a determination not to transgress again.</p>
<p>Fortifications are a proof of combined action leading to a common
end; they imply social organization, chiefs to command, workmen to
obey. A recent discovery enables us to form a very accurate picture of
prehistoric men gathered together not only for purposes of defence, but
in a society already rich, industrious, and, if we may so speak,
learning to cultivate the arts of peace.</p>
<p>The &AElig;gean Sea has ever been the theatre of igneous phenomena,
and the three little islands of Thera, Therasia, and Aspronisi, which
shut in the Bay of Santorin, are built up chiefly of volcanic
materials.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5924src" href="#xd21e5924" name=
"xd21e5924src">38</a> In 1573 an eruptive cone suddenly appeared; in
1707 the inhabitants of Santorin saw rise up a short distance from
their shores a rock that increased in size for several days and then
suddenly split up. This splitting up was succeeded by a great eruption
of incandescent materials; an eruption which lasted for no less than
five years, forming at the end of that time an island some 400 feet
high by 3,279 feet in circumference. In 1866, after many violent shocks
of earthquake, the ground was rent asunder on this island and masses of
volcanic matter were belched forth, whilst on the other side of the
island the soil sank to such a degree that canoes were used to get to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5930" href="#xd21e5930" name=
"xd21e5930">309</a>]</span>houses which but the day before were nine
feet above the sea-level. This eruption went on until 1870, and the
quantity of scori&aelig; vomited forth during its continuance welded
three islets, which had hitherto been separate, to the principal
island, of which they now form part. On entering the Bay of Santorin we
see on every side banks of lava, beds of scori&aelig;, and piles of
cinders of a purplish-gray color rising in cliffs to a height of more
than 1,312 feet. All these materials are the result of innumerable
eruptions, and the central crater of the volcano is probably situated
about the middle of the bay. It is supposed that at one time a conical
mountain, from 1,958 to 2,600 feet high, rose where soundings now give
a depth of water of over 1,300 feet. A sudden break up of the mountain
probably produced this abyss, and formidable eruptions have led to the
pouring forth of immense quantities of pumice-stone. The three islets
mentioned above would be the remains of the old central cone, and a bed
of pumice-stone from 98 to 131 feet thick is spread over the whole of
their surface, telling of a violent cataclysm of which neither history
nor tradition has preserved the memory.</p>
<p>The letters of Pliny the Younger<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5934src"
href="#xd21e5934" name="xd21e5934src">39</a> say that the eruption of
Vesuvius which caused the destruction of Portici lasted five days, and
we know that the houses are covered with a uniformly distributed bed of
pumice-stone some thirteen feet thick, and of cinders about three feet
thick. Everything points to the conclusion that a very similar
catastrophe overtook Santorin; there too whole villages were buried
beneath cinders, stones, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5937" href=
"#xd21e5937" name="xd21e5937">310</a>]</span>and molten lava, belched
forth by a volcano in action; there too men were the witnesses and the
victims of the eruption, as is proved by an accidental circumstance
which took place some twenty-three years after.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5939src" href="#xd21e5939" name="xd21e5939src">40</a></p>
<p>The removal of the <i>pouzzolana</i>, so called after the volcanic
ashes of Pozzuoli in Italy for the works on the Isthmus of Suez,
necessitated important excavations, and the cuttings revealed the
existence of dwellings which had been bidden away from the light of day
for many centuries. The masses of rubbish hiding these prehistoric
ruins were some sixty-five feet high, and consisted chiefly of volcanic
ashes piled up, for some accidental reason, in comparatively modern
times. Beneath the <i>pouzzolana</i> a thin layer of humus contains
fragments of pottery of Hellenic origin; which marks the close of the
historic period, and covers over the mass of pumiceous tufa vomited out
by the volcano. It was in this tufa, which is eight feet thick, that
the first signs of buildings were discovered. Further excavation
brought to light two houses with doors, windows, and bearing walls. In
one of these houses there were five different rooms. Other discoveries
rapidly succeeded each other, alike in the island of Therasia and at
Acrotiri, the principal island, which has given its name to the group.
The plan of these houses is an irregular parallelogram, the angles of
which are rounded and the sides more or less curved. This arrangement
differs greatly from that adopted in Greece as well as from that in use
at Therasia after the time of the volcanic eruptions. The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5963" href="#xd21e5963" name=
"xd21e5963">311</a>]</span>houses too are quite different in their mode
of construction. The walls consist of great blocks of lava placed one
above the other, without any trace of cement or of lime, and are merely
kept in place by a reddish earth mixed with chopped straw or marine
algae. Large branches of olive or cypress trees, still with the bark
on, are imbedded in the masonry. These pieces of wood, the size of
which varies considerably, were probably added to give the necessary
solidity to the walls in the numerous earthquakes, the disastrous
effects of which were only too well known to the ancient inhabitants of
Santorin. It is curious and interesting to note the use of the same
expedient among the inhabitants of the islands of the Archipelago who
are still exposed to the same danger. The doors and windows are
clumsily arched, and the roof seems to have been a low vault. It was
made of stones and coated with clay and supported by the trunks of
olive trees, the charred remains of which lay upon the floors of the
crushed homes. These trunks show no sign of having been touched with
metal tools; not a metal nail or clamp has been found, and we cannot
but conclude that the remains belong to the age when stone alone was
employed.</p>
<p>The inside walls were not glazed or decorated in any way, except in
one instance, that of a house at Acrotiri, from which the rubbish has
been cleared away, revealing on the walls a layer of lime on which was
some colored ornamentation which still retained an extraordinary
brilliancy when it was discovered.</p>
<p>In all the houses and in every room of each were found beneath the
tufa burying them masses of lava and volcanic scoriae, forming a most
eloquent witness <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5969" href=
"#xd21e5969" name="xd21e5969">312</a>]</span>of the cause of their
destruction. Near one of the houses of Therasia is a little cylindrical
structure, about three feet high; which cannot have been a well, as it
rests directly on impermeable lava, and was certainly not a cistern, as
it is too small for that. May it, as some think, have been an altar? We
cannot tell, and though the religious sentiment was probably no more
absent among these primitive races than it is among the barbarous
peoples of our own day, it does not do to express an opinion in the
absence of positive proof.</p>
<p>Successive excavations have yielded a number of objects which throw
a new light upon the manners and customs of the inhabitants.
Terra-cotta vases are more numerous than anything else (<a href=
"#fig088">Fig. 88</a>), and among them preponderate large yellow
vessels capable of holding about one hundred quarts. Most of them have
a clumsy brim, and a rough attempt has been made at ornamentation by
the potter with his fingers on the damp clay. Other vases of finer
clay, colored red or yellow, are covered with ornaments and graceful
arabesques; the garlands of fruit and flowers are often of remarkably
beautiful workmanship. Cups with well-shaped rounded handles, made of
some kind of red ferruginous earth, others of gray material, were
picked up in all the houses. These various vessels were used for many
different purposes; some to cook food, the marks of the hearth being
still on them, whilst others retained some of the chopped straw with
which the domestic animals had evidently been fed. The most curious of
all are those which are supposed to represent a woman; the front part
projecting and surmounted by a narrow neck bent backwards, with two
brown prominences supposed to stand for breasts, and dots round the
upper part representing a necklace, while ear-rings are indicated by
elliptical bands of different colors. We shall have to refer again to
these curious vases when we speak of the discoveries made at Troy; we
need only add now that the pottery found at Santorin differs
completely, alike in form and ornamentation, from the Greek,
Ph&oelig;nician, and Etruscan specimens, of which the museums of Europe
contain so many. They are evidently therefore not of foreign origin,
but of native manufacture. The absence of clay in the island of
Santorin has thrown some doubt on this, however, but the researches of
M. Fouqu&eacute; have revealed the former existence of a large valley,
at the base of the principal cone, which valley ran down to the
sea-shore near the island of Aspronisi; and in which probably was found
the clay which the potters of the district soon learned to turn to
account.</p>

<p class="first">Vases found at Santorin.</p>
</div>
<p>With these vases were found some troughs for holding crushed grain,
and lava discs very much like those still in use among the weavers of
the Archipelago to stretch the woof of their tissues; skilfully
graduated lava weights, the correlation of which is very evident, as
they weigh 8, 24, and 96 ounces; a flint arrow-head and a saw of the
same material with regular teeth; together with a great variety of
other objects, including many obsidian arrows and knives, reminding us
in their shape of those characteristic of the Stone age in North
Europe.</p>
<p>Two rings of gold beaten very thin, and a little copper saw with no
trace of any alloy, are, so far, the only metal objects found in the
excavations. The origin of the former, moreover, is very uncertain, and
there has been much discussion as to where the rings <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5985" href="#xd21e5985" name=
"xd21e5985">315</a>]</span>came from. In spite, however, of all the
gaps in the evidence about them, there remains no doubt that the
inhabitants of Santorin were farther advanced in civilization than the
Lake dwellers of Switzerland, the builders of the <i>terremare</i> of
Italy, or the Iberians of the south of Spain, who were very probably
their contemporaries; and we cannot refrain from expressing our
admiration of the wonderful progress made by the inhabitants of the
little group of volcanic islands under notice.</p>
<p>Before the catastrophe which overwhelmed them, Santorin was covered
with comfortable and solidly built houses. Men knew how to till the
ground, and gathered in crops of cereals, among which barley was the
most abundant, then millet, lentils, peas, coriander, and anise; they
had learned to domesticate animals, as is proved beyond a doubt by the
number of bones of sheep and goats; they kept dogs to guard their
flocks, and horses to aid in agricultural work; they knew how to weave
stuffs, to grind grain, to extract the oil from olives, and even to
make cheese, if we may give that name to the pasty white stuff found at
the bottom of a vase by Dr. Nomicos. They were acquainted with the
arch, and they used durable and brilliant colors. The copper saw is an
example of the first efforts of the natives at metallurgy; the gold and
obsidian which were foreign to the island bear witness to commercial
relations with people at a distance. They loved art, as proved by the
shape of their vases and the ornamentation on many of them, which is
really often worthy of the best days of Greece. All around we see signs
appearing as it were suddenly of a civilization, the origin and
tendencies of which are alike still unknown. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5992" href="#xd21e5992" name=
"xd21e5992">315</a>]</span></p>
<p>But one human skeleton has so far been found in Santorin, and that
is of an inhabitant who had evidently been overtaken in his flight and
crushed beneath the burning scori&aelig; from the volcano. This man was
of medium height, and is supposed to have been between forty and
forty-eight years old. The bones of the pelvis are firmly consolidated,
and the teeth are worn with mastication.</p>
<p>Let us endeavor to guess at the period when the people of Santorin
lived. De Longp&eacute;rier tells us that vases similar to those left
by them are represented on the tomb of Rekmara amongst the presents
offered to Thothmes III., who lived in the eighth century B.C., but if
so the people of Santorin appear to have borrowed nothing in their
intercourse with Egypt. The first invasion of Greece by the
Ph&oelig;nicians is supposed to have been in the fifteenth century
B.C., but the buildings, the pottery, and the various implements of
Therasia and Acrotiri differ essentially from those of the
Ph&oelig;nicians, who, moreover, from the earliest times, used metals.
Must we not therefore conclude that the catastrophe which overwhelmed
Santorin took place before the fifteenth century B.C.? Conjectures as
to the date of the fatal eruption, however plausible, are of no use in
anything relating to the origin of the people, or the time of their
first occupation of the island. On these points all is still hopeless
confusion, and we must wait for further discoveries before we can hope
to come to any conclusions in the matter.</p>
<p>We have gone back to the very earliest days of man upon the earth;
we have shown that he was the contemporary of the mammoth and the
rhinoceros, of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5999" href=
"#xd21e5999" name="xd21e5999">317</a>]</span>cave-lion and the
cave-bear; we have seen him crouching in the deep recesses of his cave
and fighting the battle of life with no weapon but a few scarcely
sharpened flints, leading an existence infinitely more wretched than
the animals about him. Not without emotion have we watched our remote
ancestors in their ceaseless struggle for existence; not without
emotion have we seen them gradually growing in intelligence and energy,
and attaining by slow degrees to a certain amount of civilization.
Santorin is a striking and brilliant proof of their progress, and we
shall appreciate this progress yet more when we have examined the ruins
piled up on the hill of Hissarlik. There we shall close this portion of
our work, for from the time when the buildings of which these remains
were the relics met their doom, the use of metals, copper, bronze,
gold, silver, and iron became general. History began to be written, and
it is her task to tell us of the migrations of races, the early efforts
of historic, races, the foundation of empires. In a word, the
prehistoric age was over; that of self-conscious portraiture was now to
begin.</p>
<p>A few years ago I was on the ancient Hellespont and my
fellow-travellers, grouped about the deck of our vessel, were trying to
make out on the receding coast of Asia the sites of Troy and of the
tumuli which were then still supposed to have been the tombs of
Achilles, Patrokles, and Hector, but which are now, thanks to the able
researches of Dr. Schliemann, known to belong to a comparatively modern
epoch. The streams, bearing the ever memorable names of Simo&iuml;s and
Scamander, were also eagerly pointed out by the watchers, recalling the
words of Lamartine: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6004" href=

<p class="line">Des yeux cherchait encore</p>
<p class="line">Le palais de Priam et les tours d&rsquo;Ilium.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Great indeed is the privilege of genius, immortalizing
all that it touches; for it must be pointed out that Troy was never an
important town, and the war in which it disappeared was in reality but
one of the incessant struggles between the petty princes of Greece and
Asia.</p>
<p>When I visited the East, scholars were not at all agreed as to the
site of the town which was so long besieged by the Greeks; and certain
sceptical spirits even went so far as to deny that there ever was such
a person as Homer at all, or that if there were, he wrote the epic poem
which has borne his name so long. Tradition, however, was pretty
constant in pointing to the hill of Hissarlik as the site on which Troy
was built. Strabo was quite an exception in relegating the town to the
lower end of the bay; where the miserable little village of Akshi-koi
now stands. In 1788 a new idea was started; Lechevalier in his account
of his journey in Troas claims to have recognized the site of Troy at
Bunarbashi. At that time erudition was not very profound, and
Lechevalier&rsquo;s site was accepted; indeed it was long maintained,
and quite recently it has been defended by Perrot. But the nineteenth
century is more exacting; the most plausible hypotheses are not enough
without facts to support them, and excavations at Akshi-koi and at
Bunarbashi show that there never was a town on either of these
sites.</p>
<p>Excavations on the hill of Hissarlik, begun by Dr. Schliemann in
1871, and carried on under his superintendence for more than ten years,
have, on the contrary, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6019" href=
"#xd21e6019" name="xd21e6019">319</a>]</span>yielded most definite,
satisfactory, and conclusive results. At a depth of fifty-two feet the
diggers came to the virgin soil, a very hard conchiferous limestone.
The immense masses of <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of which the embankment is
made up date front different epochs; we have before us, if we may use
such an expression, a perpendicular Pentapolis or series of five
ancient cities one above the other. One town was destroyed by assault
and by fire; another rapidly rose from its ruins, built with stones
taken front the midst of those very remains. The study of the piled-up
rubbish enables us to build up again a picture of the remote past with
all its vicissitudes, and Virchow may well say that the hill of
Hissarlik will for ever be considered one of the best authenticated
witnesses of the progress of civilization.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6024src" href="#xd21e6024" name="xd21e6024src">41</a></p>
<p>The first layer of rubbish rests on the rock itself, and may very
well have belonged to the town built by Dardanus, of which Tlepolemus
relates the destruction by his grandfather Hercules.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e6038src" href="#xd21e6038" name="xd21e6038src">42</a>
According to the Homeric story six generations, and according to
generally accepted modern calculations two centuries, separate Dardanus
from Priam. If therefore we accept 1200 B.C. as the date of the Trojan
war, the town built by Dardanus would date from 1400 B.C., and we
should possess data, if not absolutely certain, at least approximately
so.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6041src" href="#xd21e6041" name=
"xd21e6041src">43</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6044" href=
"#xd21e6044" name="xd21e6044">320</a>]</span></p>
<p>There remain but a few relics of the buildings erected by the first
inhabitants of the bill of Hissarlik, which relics consist of great
blocks of irregular size, with remains of bearing walls composed of
small stones cemented together with clay and faced with a glaze which
has withstood the wear and tear of centuries.</p>
<p>The second town, which would appear to have been that described in
the Iliad, was probably built by a race foreign to those who erected
the first. The hill, which was to become the Acropolis of the new town,
was surrounded by the new-comers with a wall several feet thick, of
which the foundations consisted of unhewn stones; whilst the upper part
was made of artificially baked bricks, the baking having been done
after they were put in place, by large fires lit in vacant places left
at regular intervals; an arrangement recalling what we have said in
speaking of vitrified forts.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6049src" href=
"#xd21e6049" name="xd21e6049src">44</a> It is also interesting to note
a similar mode of construction at Aztalan in Wisconsin in structures
which probably date from the time of the Mound Builders. The walls at
Hissarlik were protected by re-entering angles and projecting forts.
The interior of the <i>enceinte</i> was reached by three doors, and it
is still easy to make out the ruins of the different buildings. A room
sixty-five feet long by thirty-two wide is surrounded by very thick
walls, and towards the southeast is a square vestibule, opening into
the room by a large door.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6058src" href=
"#xd21e6058" name="xd21e6058src">45</a> These, Dr. Schliemann thinks,
were the <i>naos</i> and <i>pronaos</i> of a temple dedicated to the
tutelary gods of the town. Quite close to them is another building with
similar dispositions; a square vestibule giving access to a large room,
which in its turn leads to a smaller apartment. These two buildings,
which are reached through a <i>propyl&aelig;um</i>, are the only ones
of which the explorers have been able to make out the measurements with
any exactitude.</p>
<p>Other ruins are evidently remains of the royal residence. The homes
of the people were clustered on the sides and at the foot of the hill.
After the destruction of the town by the Greeks, the Acropolis formed
one vast mass of ruins, from which bits of walls stood out here and
there as mute witnesses of the catastrophe. The thin layer of black
earth covering the ruins seems to point to the speedy rebuilding of the
town. The houses of the third settlement are very irregularly grouped,
and consisted mostly of one story only, containing a number of very
small rooms. Some of the walls are of bricks with glazed facings,
others of very small stones cemented together with clay. In one house
of rather larger size than the others was found some cement made of
cinders, mixed with fragments of charcoal, broken bones, and the
remains of shells and pottery. On the northwest the new colonists
erected walls in place of those which had fallen down, but they were of
very inferior masonry, coarse bricks baked on the spot, in the way
customary among the Trojans, having formed the material.</p>
<p>The destruction of the third town was more complete than that of
Troy. The walls of the houses can still be made out rising to a certain
height, and it was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6078" href=
"#xd21e6078" name="xd21e6078">322</a>]</span>upon them as foundations
that the fourth colony set up their abodes. These dwellings are smaller
still, with flat roofs formed of beams on which was laid a coating of
rushes and clay. Every generation appears to have been poorer than the
last, alike in material wealth and in fertility of resource.</p>
<p>The fifth colony spread northwards and eastwards. Their homes were
built very much in the same style as those of their predecessors. The
resemblance does not end there, and Dr. Schliemann notes that among the
ruins of the three towns, which successively rose from the site of
Troy, are found similar strange-looking idols, hatchets in jade,
porphyry, diorite, and bronze, goblets with two handles, clumsy stone
hammers, trachyte grindstones, and fusa&iuml;oles or perforated whorls
bearing symbolic signs of a similar form. Evidently the men who
succeeded each other after the great siege of Troy on the now
celebrated hill of Hissarlik belonged to the same race, perhaps even to
the same tribe. There are, however, certain notable differences which
must not be passed over. The later pottery is not of such fine clay or
so well moulded as the earlier specimens, nor are the stone hammers,
which appear to have been the chief implements used, of such good
workmanship. The piles of shells left to accumulate about the houses of
the fourth and fifth towns can only be compared to the kitchen-middings
so often referred to, and there is no doubt that those who left such
heaps of rubbish about their dwellings could not have been so civilized
as were the celebrated Trojans.</p>
<p>Beneath the ruins of the Greek town, which strictly speaking belongs
to history, Schliemann found a quantity <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e6085" href="#xd21e6085" name="xd21e6085">323</a>]</span>of
pottery of curious shapes and very different to anything he had
previously discovered. He ascribes them to a Lydian colony which dwelt
for a short time upon the hill. This pottery resembles that known as
proto-Etruscan, of which so many specimens have been found in Italy.
Probably the makers of both were contemporaries.</p>
<p>By numerous and careful measurements Dr. Schliemann has been able to
determine exactly the thickness of the layers, which correspond with
the different periods during which Hissarlik was inhabited. The remains
of the Greek and Lydian towns extend to a depth of 7&frac12; feet
beneath the actual level of the soil; the fourth layer, from 7&frac12;
to 15 feet; the third, from 15 to 22&frac12; feet; Troy itself, from
22&frac12; to 32 feet; and lastly Dardania, from 32 to 52 feet. The
last layer carries us back to the golden age of Greek art, where all
doubt is finally at an end. The bas-reliefs of remarkable workmanship
bear witness to the Ilium, founded in memory of Troy. This is the town
visited by Xerxes, Alexander the Great, and Julian the
Apostate.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6089src" href="#xd21e6089" name=
"xd21e6089src">46</a> That the town still existed about the middle of
the fourth century is proved by medals taken from the ruins, but it
evidently fell into decadence soon after that time, for its very name
was forgotten by history, and it was reserved for our own time to
resuscitate the ancient city of Priam and its successors from the ruins
which lead been piled up by the destructive hand of man and by the
lapse of tinge. But this task has been nobly achieved by the
enthusiasm, scientific <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6092" href=
"#xd21e6092" name="xd21e6092">324</a>]</span>acumen, and we may perhaps
add good-fortune of an arch&aelig;ologist who cherished a positive
passion for everything relating to Homeric times.</p>
<p>The number of objects picked up at different stages of the
excavations was very considerable. Dr. Schliemann neglected absolutely
nothing that appeared to him at all worthy of his collection, which now
belongs to the Royal Museum of Berlin and contains some twenty thousand
objects, including weapons and implements, some of stone, others of
bronze, and thousands of vases and fusa&iuml;oles, gazing upon which we
see rise before our eyes a picture of a civilization unknown before but
through the Iliad and a few meagre historical allusions.</p>
<p>Before we note in detail the most remarkable of the objects in Dr.
Schliemann&rsquo;s collection, we must add that recent researches have
also brought to light the remains of a little temple dedicated to
Pallas Athene and referred to in history, as well as those of a large
Doric temple erected by Lysimachus, and of a magnificent theatre
capable of holding six thousand spectators, and which probably dates
from the end of the Roman Republic. The human bones picked lip among
the ruins of the different towns play be attributed to the practice,
already general, of cremation. Virchow has examined the skull of a
woman found at Troy, which is of a pronounced brachycephalic type
(82.5). The crania from the third town, on the other hand, are
dolichocephalic, the mean cranial capacity being sixty-seven. If we
could reason with any certainty from cranial capacity, this would
appear to point to a different race, but it would not do to come to any
positive conclusion with only one Trojan cranium to judge by.

</div>
<p>But to return to Dr. Schliemann&rsquo;s fine collection. The pottery
from the first town, found at a depth of from thirty-two to fifty-two
feet (<a href="#fig089">Fig. 89</a>), is superior alike in color, form,
and construction, to the keramic ware of the following periods. The
potter&rsquo;s wheel was unknown, or at least very rarely
used,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6110src" href="#xd21e6110" name=
"xd21e6110src">47</a> and pottery was hand made and polished with bone
or wood polishers, the marks of which can still be made out. The forms
are varied and often graceful, many of them, as do those found in the
mounds of North America imitating those of the animals among which the
potters lived. The usual color of the keramic ware is black, some times
decorated with white lozenge-shaped ornaments. Some vases have also
been found colored red, yellow, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e6113" href="#xd21e6113" name="xd21e6113">326</a>]</span>and
brown, and even decked with garlands of flower and fruit, as are some
of those of Santorin. We must also mention some apodal vases, and
others with three feet, used for funeral purposes, containing human
ashes (<a href="#fig090">Fig. 90</a>). The terra-cotta fusa&iuml;oles,
found in such numbers among the ruins of the towns that rose
successively from the hill of Hissarlik, are, on the other hand, rare
at Dardania, if we may retain that name.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>Excavations have brought to light more than six hundred celts or
knives, generally of smaller size than those found in Denmark or
France. Rock of many kinds, including serpentine, schist, felsite,
jadeite, diorite, and nephrite, were used; and saws of flint or
chalcedony, some toothed on one side only, others on both, are of
frequent occurrence. They were fixed into handles of wood or horn, and
kept in place with some agglutinative substance, such as pitch, several
of them still retaining traces of this primitive glue. We must also
mention awls, pins of bone and ivory, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e6131" href="#xd21e6131" name="xd21e6131">328</a>]</span>ossicles
or knuckle bones, in every stage of manufacture, confirming the
accounts of Greek historians, who tell us of the great antiquity of the
game played with them. The Dardanians used wooden and bone implements
and weapons almost exclusively. It is impossible to say whether they
were acquainted with the use of metals, but we might assert that they
were if we could quite certainly attribute to them a certain mould of
mica schist, found at a depth of 45&frac12; feet, which bad been used
in the process of casting spits and pins, which are supposed to be of
more ancient date than the fibul&aelig;.</p>

<p>The most valuable objects of the collection come from the deposits
representing the town of Troy; they are all twisted, broken, and
charred, bearing witness <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6151" href=
"#xd21e6151" name="xd21e6151">329</a>]</span>to the fierceness of the
flames in which the town perished. These discoveries reveal to us the
daily life of the people of Troy. Judging from the number of
boars&rsquo; tusks found, hunting must have been a favorite pastime
with them. The bones of oxen, sheep, and goats, of smaller species than
those of the present day, have also been found. Horses and dogs were
rare, and cats unknown. The domestic poultry of the present day was
also wanting, no remains of birds having been found except a few bones
of the wild swan and the wild goose. Fish and mollusca, as proved by
the immense numbers of bones and shells, formed an important part of
the diet of the Trojans. They also fed largely on cereals, which they
cultivated with success; and wheat, the grains of which were very
small, was known to them. The preservation of these vegetable relics
was due to carbonization.</p>

gave free vent to his imagination, but the decorations representing

inferior execution.</p>

"xd21e6206">331</a>]</span>mention, one representing animals, generally
pigs (<a href="#fig096">Fig. 96</a>), though an example has been found
of a hippopotamus; a fact of very great interest, as this animal does
not live at the present day anywhere but in the heart of Africa. We
know from this terra-cotta representation that it lived in Greece in
the days of Troy. Pliny speaks of it in Upper Egypt in his day, and
according to Mariette it lived thirty-five centuries before the
Christian era in the delta formed by the mouth of the Nile. The second
series of objects referred to above as of special interest are vases
representing the heads of owls with the busts of women (<a href=
"#fig097">Fig. 97</a>). It is easy to make out the beak, eyes, and ears
of the bird, and the breasts and navel of the woman. In some instances
the face, breasts, and sexual organs of a woman are represented by a
series of dots forming a triangle with the point downwards.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6214src" href="#xd21e6214" name=
"xd21e6214src">51</a> Other dots represent a necklace, and very similar
designs are to be seen on the Chaldean cylinders. Can we then connect
them in any way with the relics of Troy, and is it possible that the
Trojans and Chaldeans were of common origin? However that may be, the
constant repetition of these signs proves that they were of hieratic
character. Terra-cotta was also used for a very great number of other
purposes, as was the case everywhere before the introduction of metals.
Some deep and some flat plates made of very common clay have been
found, together with buttons, funnels, bells, children&rsquo;s toys,
and seals on which, some authorities think, Hittite characters can be
made out. No lamps, or anything that could serve their purpose, have
been found. The Trojans probably used torches of resinous wood or
braziers, when they required artificial light.</p>
<p>It would be impossible to give a list of the objects of every
variety found among the ruins of Troy, with the aid of which we can
form a very definite idea of the private life of its people. Some
fragments of an ivory lyre, and some pipes pierced with three holes at
equal distances, bear witness to their taste for music; a distaff,
still full of charred wool, deserted by the spinner when she fled
before the conflagration, tells of domestic industry and manual
dexterity, while marble <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6219" href=
"#xd21e6219" name="xd21e6219">333</a>]</span>and stone phalli prove
that the generative forces of nature were worshipped.<a class="noteref"

</div>
<p>The weapons and implements found included h&aelig;matite and diorite
projectiles used in slings, stone hatchets, and hammers pierced to
receive handles, flint saws and obsidian knives. Metallurgy began to
play an important part, and stone with its minor resisting power was
quickly superseded by bronze. In fact, Virchow <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6245" href="#xd21e6245" name=
"xd21e6245">334</a>]</span>was certainly justified in saying that the
whole town belonged to the Bronze age. Iron was still unknown, at least
so far no trace of it has been found, either among the ruins of Troy or
of the towns which succeeded it. Several crucibles and moulds of mica,
schist, or clay have been found with one of granite of rectangular
shape bearing on each face the hollows in tended to receive the fused
metal. The Schliemann <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6247" href=

"xd21e6255src">54</a> and thousands of spits, some with spherically
shaped heads, others of spiral form. Some of these spits are made of
copper, as are some large nails weighing thirty ounces, so that this
metal was evidently still often used in a pure state.</p>

shields, vases (<a href="#fig098">Fig. 98</a>), and dishes mixed
together in the greatest confusion, often soldered together by the
intense heat to which they had been subjected. They had probably been

"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6287" href="#xd21e6287" name=

and bottles of gold (Figs. <a href="#fig099">99</a> and <a href=

"xd21e6299src" href="#xd21e6299" name="xd21e6299src">57</a> The
ornaments that had belonged to women are especially curious. At one
place alone several diadems (<a href="#fig101">Fig. 101</a>) were
picked up, with fifty-six ear-rings, six bracelets, and nine thousand
minor objects, such as rings, buckles, buttons, dice, pins, beads, and
ornaments of a great variety.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6305src" href=
"#xd21e6305" name="xd21e6305src">58</a> All these treasures were piled
up in a great silver vase, into which they had doubtless been hastily
thrown in the confusion of a precipitate flight. They are all of
characteristic forms, quite unlike anything in Assyrian or Egyptian
art. Were they made in Troy itself? Dr. Schliemann doubts it; he thinks
that the makers of such clumsy pottery are not likely to have been able
to produce jewelry of such delicate and remarkable workmanship. I
should not like to be so positive, for even amongst the most advanced
peoples we find very common objects mixed with others showing artistic
skill. Why should it not have been the same at Troy? I think that in
future Trojan art must take its place in the history of the progress of
humanity. The nineteenth century has brought that art to light, and by
a strange caprice of chance the treasures of Priam adorn the museum of
Berlin, and we have seen the diadem of fair Helen exhibited in the
South Kensington Museum of London.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6308src"
href="#xd21e6308" name="xd21e6308src">59</a> <span class=

<p>Treasures nearly as valuable as those we have been describing were
found in earthenware vases in several other parts of the ruins.
Unfortunately, many of the objects found were stolen and melted down by
the workmen, whilst others were taken to the Imperial Palace at
Constantinople, whence they are doomed to be dispersed. In 1873,
however, Dr. Schliemann was fortunate enough to hit upon a deposit
containing twenty gold ear-rings, and four golden ornaments which had
formed part of a necklace.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6325src" href=
"#xd21e6325" name="xd21e6325src">60</a> Similar ornaments were found at
Myken&aelig;, near Bologna, in the Caucasus, in the Lake dwellings,
and, stranger still, on the banks of the Rio Suarez in
Colombia.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6331src" href="#xd21e6331" name=
"xd21e6331src">61</a></p>
<p>I will not add more to what I have already said about the towns
which succeeded each other on the ruins of Troy, and of which the
successive stages of rubbish on the hill of Hissarlik are the only
witnesses left. The flames spared none who settled on that doomed spot,
and new arrivals disappeared as rapidly as they came. The Ilium of the
Greeks and Romans alone enjoyed any prosperity, but it too was in its
turn swept away; and at the present day a few wandering shepherds and
their flocks are the sole dwellers upon the hill immortalized by
Homer.</p>
<p>Before concluding this chapter I must refer once <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6338" href="#xd21e6338" name=
"xd21e6338">339</a>]</span>more to a fact of considerable interest. In
that part of the deposits of Hissarlik which represents Troy, Dr.
Schliemann picked up the perforated whorls to which the name of
fusa&iuml;oles has been given (<a href="#fig102">Fig. 102</a>), and of
which we spoke in our account of the Lake Dwellings of Switzerland.
These fusa&iuml;oles are generally of common clay mixed with bits of
mica, quartz, or silica, though some few have been found at
Myken&aelig; and Tiryns of steatite. The clay whorls before being baked
were plunged into a bath of a very fine clay of gray, yellow, or black
color, and then carefully polished. They nearly all bear ornaments of
very primitive execution, such as stars, the sun, flowers, or animals,
and more rarely representations of the human figure.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e6344width" id="fig102"><img src=
"images/fig102.jpg" alt="" width="134" height="100">
<p class="first">Terra-cotta fusa&iuml;oles.</p>
</div>
<p>We ourselves think these fusa&iuml;oles are amulets which were taken
to Troy by the Trojans, and piously preserved by their successors. One
important fact tends to confirm this hypothesis. A great number of them
bear the sign of the <i>swastika</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6352src" href="#xd21e6352" name="xd21e6352src">62</a> (<a href=
"#fig103">Fig. 103</a>), the cross with the four arms, the sacred
symbol of the great Aryan race so long supposed to be the source of all
the Indo-European races. The <i>swastika</i> is engraved, not only on
the fusa&iuml;oles, but also on the diadems of the daughters of Priam,
on the idols the Trojans worshipped, and on numerous objects from the
Lydian and Greco-Roman towns. We meet with the double cross among the
prehistoric races of the basin of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e6364" href="#xd21e6364" name="xd21e6364">340</a>]</span>Danube,
who colonized the shores of the Troad and the north of Italy, and it
was introduced with the products of that antique civilization on the
one side to the Greeks, the Etruscans, the Latins, the Gauls, the
Germanic races, the Scandinavians, and the Bretons; and on the other to
the people of Asia Minor, Persia, India, China, and Japan.<a class=

<p class="first">Cover of a vase with the symbol of the
<i>swastika</i>. Found at Troy.</p>
</div>
<p>This sign of the <i>swastika</i> meets us at every turn; we find it
on many ancient Persian books, on the temples of India, on Celtic
funeral stones, and on a Hittite cylinder. It is seen on vases of
elegant form from Athens and Melos; on others from Ceres, Chiusi, and
Cum&aelig;, as well as on the clumsy pottery recently discovered at
K&ouml;nigswald on the Oder and on the borders of Hungary; on bronze
objects from the Caucasus, and the celebrated Albano urn; on a medal
from Gaza in Palestine and on an Iberian medal from Asido. We see it on
the Gallo-Roman rings of the Museum of Namur, and on the plaques of the
belt, dating from the same epoch, which form part of the magnificent
collection of M. Moreau. Schliemann tells us of it at Myken&aelig; and
at Tiryns. Chantre found it on the necropoles of the Caucasus. It is
engraved on the walls of the catacombs of Rome, on the chair of Saint
Ambrose at Milan, on the crumbling walls of Portici, and on the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6385" href="#xd21e6385" name=
"xd21e6385">341</a>]</span>most ancient monuments of Ireland, where it
is often associated with inscriptions in the ogham character.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6387src" href="#xd21e6387" name=
"xd21e6387src">64</a></p>
<p>The <i>swastika</i> occurs twice on a large piece of copper found at
Corneto, which now belongs to the Museum of Berlin. Cartailhac noticed
it in the <i>citania</i> of Portugal, some of which date from Neolithic
times.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6401src" href="#xd21e6401" name=
"xd21e6401src">65</a> The English in the Ashantee war noticed it on the
bronzes they took at Coomassie on the coast of Guinea, and it has also
been found on objects discovered in the English county of Norfolk.</p>

<p class="first">Stone hammer from New Jersey bearing an undeciphered

</div>
<p>Moreover, if we cross the Atlantic we find the same symbol engraved
on the temples of Yucatan, the origin of which is unknown, on a hatchet
found at Pemberton, in New Jersey (<a href="#fig104">Fig. 104</a>), on
vases from a Peruvian sepulchre near Lima, and on vessels from the
<i>pueblos</i> of New Mexico. Dr. Hamy, in his &ldquo;American
Decades,&rdquo; represents it on a flattened gourd belonging to the
Wolpi Indians, and the sacred tambours of the Esquimaux of the present
day bear the same symbol, which was probably transmitted to them by
their ancestors. The universality of this one sign amongst the Hindoos,
Persians, Hittites, Pelasgians, Celts, and Germanic races, the Chinese,
Japanese, and the primitive inhabitants of America is infinitely
strange, and seems to prove the identity of races so different to each
other, alike in appearance <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6421"
href="#xd21e6421" name="xd21e6421">342</a>]</span>and in customs, and
is a very important factor in dealing with the great problem of the
origin of the human species.</p>
<p>We have dwelt much on the discoveries of Dr. Schliemann, but we must
add that, like all great discoveries, they have been very vigorously
contested.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6425src" href="#xd21e6425" name=
"xd21e6425src">66</a> Boetticher, for instance, considers the ruins of
Hissarlik to be nothing more than the remains of a necropolis where
cremation was practised according to the Assyrio-Babylonian
custom.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6433src" href="#xd21e6433" name=
"xd21e6433src">67</a> A distinguished and very honest savant, S.
Reinach, constituted himself the champion of this theory at the meeting
of the Congress in Paris in 1889. Schliemann replied very forcibly, and
the meeting appeared to be with him in the matter, as were also a
number of men of science who visited Hissarlik in 1888, and we think
that in the end history will adopt the opinion of the great Danish
antiquarian.</p>
<p>We have now passed in review the chief of the works left behind him
by man from the earliest days of his existence to the dawn of historic
times. We must still show prehistoric man in the presence of death, the
universal destroyer, and learn from the evidence of the tombs of the
remote past how our ancestors met the common doom. <span class=

Lubbock compares the ruins of Aztalan, in America, with the vitrified

interesting to note the discovery of urns closely resembling those of
Troy, and containing human remains, in Persia (Sir W. Ouseley:
&ldquo;Travels in Persia&rdquo;), and at Travancore, in the south of
Malabar, where, according to tradition, they were intended to receive
the remains of young virgins sacrificed in honor of the

vulva was sometimes represented by a large triangle. The same
peculiarity occurs on some black marble statuettes, found in the tombs
of the Cyclades and Attica. Three such statuettes from the island of
Paros are in the Louvre, and the British Museum owns a rich collection.
Dr. Schliemann also mentions a female idol made in lead of very coarse

<i>phallus</i> was, as we have already stated, the symbol of generative
force. Its worship extended throughout India and Syria; a gigantic
Phallus adorned the temple of the mother of the gods at Hierapolis, and
it was carried in triumph in processions through Egypt and Greece. It
is still worshipped in some places at the present day. Near Niombo, in
Africa, there is a temple <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6226"
href="#xd21e6226" name="xd21e6226">334n</a>]</span>containing several
phallic statues; at Stanley-Pool the f&ecirc;te of the <i>phallus</i>
is celebrated with obscene rites. The Kroomen observe similar
ceremonies at the time of the new moon, and in Japan on certain
f&ecirc;te clays young girls flourish gigantic <i>phalli</i> at the end
of long poles. The <i>phallus</i> is also often represented on the
monuments of Central America&mdash;on the stones of the temples of
Izamal and the island of Zapatero, for instance. Possibly the worship
of the productive and generative forces of nature was the earliest
religion of many primitive peoples, but all that is said on the subject
must be sifted with considerable care.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

<p class="first">The true history of man will be found in his tombs,
says Thucydides; and as a matter of fact the sepulchre has ever
occupied much of the thoughts of man, the result of a religious
sentiment, a conviction that all does not end with the life which so
quickly passes by.</p>
<p>From the very earliest times we meet with tokens of the hopes and
fears connected with a future existence; but, as I have already stated,
the human bones that can with certainty be said to date from
Pal&aelig;olithic times are very rare. We know but very few facts
justifying us in asserting that the contemporary of the mammoth and of
the cave bear had already learnt to respect the remains of what had
once been a man like himself. One of these few facts deserves, I think,
to be noticed with some detail.</p>
<p>In 1886, excavations in the cave of Spy<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6454src" href="#xd21e6454" name="xd21e6454src">1</a> (Namur),
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6476" href="#xd21e6476" name=
"xd21e6476">344</a>]</span>or rather in a terrace some thirty-six feet
long by nineteen and a half wide giving access to it, brought to light
two human skeletons. One was that of an individual already advanced in
life, probably of the feminine sex, the other of a man in the prime of
life. These skeletons were imbedded in a very hard breccia containing
also fragments of ivory and numerous flints of very small size. Some of
them had very fine scratches on both sides. From what I could learn on
the spot, the skeletons when found were in a recumbent position. The
bones, few of which were missing, were still in their natural position,
and near to one of them were picked up several arrow- or lance-heads,
one of which, of phtanite, some two and a half inches long, was of the
purest Moust&eacute;rien type. The bones were those of short, squat
individuals, and the skulls were of the type of the Canstadt race, the
most ancient of which anything is known; the thickness of the crania
was about one third of an inch. The forehead, is low and retreating,
the eyebrows are prominent, and the lower jaws strong and well
developed.</p>
<p>At the same level and in that immediately above it were picked up
the remains of the mammoth, the <i>Rhinoceros tichorhinus</i>, the cave
bear, and the large cave hyena, the reindeer, and numerous other
mammals belonging to the Quaternary fauna. Everything points to the
conclusion that the man and woman whose remains have so opportunely
come to light were contemporary with these animals, and that their
bodies were placed after death in the cave in which they were
found.</p>
<p>Belgium has furnished numerous examples of sepulchral caves, of a
date, however, less ancient than that <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e6485" href="#xd21e6485" name="xd21e6485">345</a>]</span>we have
been considering. Recent excavations in the Chauvaux Cave revealed two
skeletons leaning against the walls in a crouching position, the legs
tucked under the body. In the Gendron Cave M. Dupont discovered
seventeen skeletons lying in a low, narrow passage, stretched out at
full length with the feet toward the wall, and arranged in twos and
threes, one above the other. In the middle of all these dead was the
skeleton of one man placed upright, as if to watch over the other
bodies.</p>
<p>The Duruthy Cave at Sordes opens near the point of junction of the
waters of the Pan and Oloron, whence their united waters flow into the
Adour. At the northern extremity of this cave is a natural niche in
which lay more than thirty skeletons, some of men, some of women, and
some of children, mixed together in the greatest confusion. Worked
flints, bone stilettos, and ornaments lay around, all of the forms
characteristic of Pal&aelig;olithic times.</p>
<p>It would seem that we have here evidence of the practice of a
funeral rite, which consisted in first stripping the bodies of flesh,
and then laying the bones in caves, where they were often left
unnoticed by the living occupants of the same refuge.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e6491src" href="#xd21e6491" name="xd21e6491src">2</a></p>
<p>The caves of Baouss&eacute;-Rouss&eacute;, near Mentone, give fresh
proof of the extension of this rite, if we may so call it. The
skeletons lay upon a bed of powdered iron ore, in some cases as much as
two fifths of an inch <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6505" href=
"#xd21e6505" name="xd21e6505">346</a>]</span>thick, and this
accumulation could not have taken place if the skeleton had not been
deprived of its flesh before inhumation. The flesh must have been taken
off by some rapid process, for the bones remain, as a general rule, in
their natural positions, united by their tendons and ligaments. In
Italy, says Issel, the cave men buried their dead in the caves they
lived in, a thin layer of earth alone separating them from the living;
the bodies, adds Pigorini,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6507src" href=
"#xd21e6507" name="xd21e6507src">3</a> generally lay on the left side,
the head rested on the left hand, and the knees were bent. Beside the
skeleton was placed a vase containing red chalk, to be used for
painting the body in the new world it was supposed to be about to
enter.</p>
<p>We could quote similar discoveries in Sicily, Belgium, and the
southern Pyrenees. Beneath the tumulus of Plouhennec, in Brittany,
bones were strewn about in the greatest disorder. Some
arch&aelig;ologists are of opinion that the openings in certain dolmens
were used for throwing in the bones of the dead who successively went
to join their ancestors. In many of the Long Barrows of England the
bones appear to have been flung in pell-mell; the space was too narrow
to hold the complete body, so that before inhumation the flesh must
have been separated from the bones. In no other way can we explain the
confusion in which the human remains lay when they were
discovered.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6515src" href="#xd21e6515" name=
"xd21e6515src">4</a> Pigorini thinks this is a proof that primitive
races worshipped their dead, and held their bodies in
veneration.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6520src" href="#xd21e6520" name=
"xd21e6520src">5</a> Perhaps they even carried them about in their
migrations. However that may be, the custom <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6525" href="#xd21e6525" name=
"xd21e6525">347</a>]</span>of separating the flesh from the bones was
continued until cremation became general. This would explain the huge
ossuaries found in regions so widely separated.</p>
<p>Although, however, the mode of sepulture we have just described was
practised for a long time in certain places, we cannot admit it to have
been general. In certain megalithic tombs we find dispositions similar
to those described in speaking of the Gendron Cave. Excavations beneath
the Port-Blanc dolmen (Morbihan) brought to light a rough pavement on
which lay numbers of skeletons, closely packed one against another,
which skeletons were probably those of men who had been held in honor,
and to commemorate whom the dolmen was set up. Separated from them by a
layer of stones and earth rested another series of skeletons, not so
closely packed as the first. The new-comers had respected their
predecessors, and no one had violated the sanctuary of the dead.
Similar facts were noted at Grand Compans, near Luzarches,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6530src" href="#xd21e6530" name="xd21e6530src">6</a>
and it is evident that successive inhumations beneath dolmens often
took place, and instances might, if necessary, be multiplied.</p>
<p>Another singular funeral rite was practised in remote antiquity.
Many of the bones found in the various caves of Mentone were colored
with red hematite.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6538src" href=
"#xd21e6538" name="xd21e6538src">7</a> As this was only the case with
the bones of adults, those of children retaining their natural
whiteness, it evidently had some special significance. In 1880, the
opening of a cave of the Stone age in the district of Anagni, a short
distance from Rome, brought <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6544"
href="#xd21e6544" name="xd21e6544">348</a>]</span>to light the facial
portion of a human cranium, colored bright red with cinnabar. Nor are
these by any means exceptional cases, for similar coloration was
noticed on bones picked up at Finalmarina and several other places in
Liguria and Sicily. The custom had therefore become general in the
Neolithic period in the whole of the Italian peninsula.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6546src" href="#xd21e6546" name="xd21e6546src">8</a>
We also meet with it in other countries; at the Prehistoric Congress,
when in session at Lisbon, Dolgado added to what was said about the
discoveries in Italy the fact that the cave men of Furninha practised a
similar rite. In the <i>kurganes</i> of the department of Kiev crania
were found colored with a mineral substance, fragments of which were
strewn about near the skeletons. The most ancient of the
<i>kurganes</i> appear to date from the Stone age, for in them were
found implements made of flint and reindeer-horn, mixed with the bones
of rodents<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6561src" href="#xd21e6561" name=
"xd21e6561src">9</a> long since extinct in that district. A similar
practice is met with in the tombs of Poland, many bones being covered
with a coating of red color, in some instances one fifth of an inch
thick. Excavations in the Kitor valley (province of Irkutsk, Siberia)
have brought to light several tombs which appear to date from the sauce
period as the <i>kurganes</i> of Kiew. The dead were buried with the
weapons and ornaments they would like to use in the new life which had
begun for them. The tomb was then filled in with sand, with which care
was taken to mix plenty of red ochre. It is difficult not to conclude
that this was a relic of a rite fallen into desuetude. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6569" href="#xd21e6569" name=
"xd21e6569">349</a>]</span></p>
<p>At the present day certain tribes of North America expose their dead
on the tops of trees, and before burying the bones, when stripped of
their flesh, cover them with a coating of a bright red color. In the
island of Espiritu Santo many human bones have also been picked up
painted with an oxide of argillaceous iron. These customs, strange as
they may appear, were evidently practised in honor of ancestors;
atavism is as clearly shown in customs and traditions as in physical
structure.</p>
<p>At Solutr&eacute; is a sepulchre formed of unhewn slabs of stone.
The body of the dead rested on a thick bed of the broken and crushed
bones of horses. The remains of reindeer were mixed with the human
bones. Were these too relics of funeral rites, and were the animal
bones those of the horses and reindeer that had belonged to their
hunter? It is impossible to say. Solutr&eacute;, situated as it was on
an admirable site on a hill overlooking the valley of the Seine,
protected from the north winds and close to a plentiful stream, has
also been a favorite resort of man. In the tombs all ages are mixed
together, and if some do indeed date from Neolithic times, others are
Roman, Burgundian, Merovingian. There may be among them a certain
number dating from the Reindeer period; that is about all we can assert
with any certainty in the present state of our knowledge. The
Abb&eacute; Ducrost, however, in an important essay<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e6574src" href="#xd21e6574" name="xd21e6574src">10</a> asserts
that he has found incontrovertible proofs of the interment of
Solutr&eacute;ens on the hearths of their homes in Pal&aelig;olithic
times. If this be so, the custom is one of frequent occurrence, and has
been continued for centuries; for <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e6579" href="#xd21e6579" name="xd21e6579">350</a>]</span>De
Colanges, in his fine work on ancient cities, shows that at Rome the
earliest tombs were on the hearth itself of the dwelling. De Mortillet,
on the other hand, dwells very earnestly on the mode of inhumation at
Solutr&eacute;, and sees in the juxtaposition of human remains and the
<i>d&eacute;bris</i> of hearths but the result of displacement, and of
the regular turning upside down of which the hill of Solutr&eacute; has
been the scene. To this Reinach replied, to the effect that, whereas a
few years ago De Mortillet&rsquo;s authority led many
arch&aelig;ologists to suppose that the men of the Reindeer period did
not bury their dead, facts, ever more important than theories, have now
proved beyond a doubt that this very decided opinion is a mistake. Not
only did the men of remote antiquity bury their dead; they laid them,
as at Solutr&eacute;, on the hearths near which they had
lived.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6584src" href="#xd21e6584" name=
"xd21e6584src">11</a></p>
<p>The dead were often buried seated or bent forward, and it is
interesting to note the same custom beneath the mounds of America and
the tumuli of Europe. It is touching to see how in death men wished to
recall their life on earth; the cradle was, so to speak, reproduced in
the tomb, and man lay on the bosom of earth, the common mother of
humanity, like the child on the bosom of his own mother. Perhaps, too,
the seated position was meant to indicate that man, who had never known
rest during his hard struggle for existence, had found it at last in
his new life. The men of the rough and barbarous times of the remote
past were unable to conceive the idea of a future different to the
present, or of a life which was not in every respect the same as that
on earth had been. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6592" href=
"#xd21e6592" name="xd21e6592">351</a>]</span></p>
<p>Whatever may have been the motive, this mode of burial was practised
from the Madeleine period.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6595src" href=
"#xd21e6595" name="xd21e6595src">12</a> At Bruniquel, in Aveyron, the
dead were found crouching in their last home. This position is,
however, peculiarly characteristic of Neolithic times, and is met with
throughout Europe. Eight skeletons were recently discovered bending
forward in the sepulchral cave of Schwann (Mecklenburg). In Scandinavia
there are so many similar cases that it is difficult to make a
selection. Tit the sepulchral cave of Oxevalla (East Gothland) the dead
are all in crouching attitudes, and tumuli dating from the most remote
antiquity cover over a passage, formed of immense blocks of stone,
leading to a central chamber, in which are numerous seated skeletons
resting against the walls.</p>
<p>On the shores of the Mediterranean, excavations of the Vence Cave
(Alpes-Maritimes) brought to light a number of dead arranged in a
circle as if about to take a meal in common. The bodies were crouching
in the position of men sitting on their heels; the spinal column was
bent forward and the head nearly touched the knees. In the centre of
this strange group were noticed some fragments of pottery and the
remains of a large bird, a buzzard probably. Perhaps its death among
the corpses was a mere accident.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6606src"
href="#xd21e6606" name="xd21e6606src">13</a> The dolmens of Aveyron
yielded some flint-flakes and arrow-heads, pieces of pottery, pendants,
and bone, stone, shell, and slate-colored schist beads. Beneath one of
these dolmens was found one small bronze object, quite an exceptional
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6611" href="#xd21e6611" name=
"xd21e6611">352</a>]</span>instance of the occurrence of that metal.
The skeletons rested against the walls. In one of the tombs some human
bones, which bad been originally placed at the entrance to the cave,
had been moved to the back; the vanquished had here, as in life, to
give way before the conquerors. Excavations in the <span class="corr"
id="xd21e6613" title="Source: Mane-Lud">Man&eacute;-Lud</span> tomb
have led explorers to suppose that here too the corpses were buried in
a crouching position. It is the same at Luzarches and in the Varennes
cemetery near Dormans.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6616src" href=
"#xd21e6616" name="xd21e6616src">14</a> In the last named were found
traces of a fire that had been lit above the tomb, and some pottery was
picked up ornamented with hollow lines, filled with some white matter
not unlike barbotine. M. de Baye says this mode of interment is
confined to the district of Marne; but for all that he himself gives an
example of its practice elsewhere.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6622src"
href="#xd21e6622" name="xd21e6622src">15</a></p>
<p>In the prehistoric tombs discovered at Cape Blanc-Nez, near Escalles
(Pas-de-Calais), the position in which the body had been interred could
be made out in four instances. The ends of the tibi&aelig;, humeri, and
radii were united, the bones of the hands were found near the
clavicles, so that the bodies had evidently been bending forward with
the arms crossed and the fingers pointing toward the
shoulders.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6629src" href="#xd21e6629" name=
"xd21e6629src">16</a> Similar facts are quoted from a cave at Equehen
on the plateau which stretches along the seashore on the east of
Boulogne. The bodies, to the number of nine, were crouching with the
face turned toward the entrance of the cave, which was closed with
great blocks of sandstone. Two polished stone hatchets, broken
doubtless in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6634" href="#xd21e6634"
name="xd21e6634">353</a>]</span>accordance with some sepulchral rite,
had been placed near the skeletons.</p>
<p>Numerous human bones were found in the Cravanche Cave near Belfort,
which probably dates from the close of the Neolithic period, judging
from the total absence of metal and the shape of the flint and bone
implements picked up. Here too the bodies were bent almost double, the
head drooping forward and the knees drawn up nearly to the chin.
Several of these skeletons were completely imbedded in the stalagmite
which had formed in the cave, the head and knees alone emerging from
the solid mass. The position in which they were originally placed had
thus of necessity been maintained.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6638src"
href="#xd21e6638" name="xd21e6638src">17</a></p>
<p>A similar rite, for rite we must call this mode of burial, was
practised in Italy, and the Chevalier de Rossi speaks of a tomb of the
Neolithic period at Cantalupo, near Rome, in which one of the bodies
wag placed in the crouching attitude, which he says is familiar to all
who have studied ancient tombs.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6648src"
href="#xd21e6648" name="xd21e6648src">18</a> This practice was still
continued in protohistoric times; Schliemann noticed it in the
excavations he superintended at Myken&aelig;, and Homer says that
amongst the Lybians the dead were buried seated.</p>
<p>The necropolis near Constantine contains numerous megalithic
monuments. These are either round or square cromlechs surrounding
sarcophagi, or circular <i>enceintes</i>, in which the dead were laid
in a trench. In the former there are always a great many funeral
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6661" href="#xd21e6661" name=
"xd21e6661">354</a>]</span>objects in the tomb, and the body of the
dead is in a crouching posture; in the latter there are few things
beside the corpse itself, and that is in a recumbent position. Do these
peculiarities denote different races? Do the tombs all date from the
same period, or are these arrangements but fresh indications of the
difference everywhere maintained between social classes? It is
difficult to decide, and we must be content with enumerating facts. We
may add, however, that the crouching position of corpses is constantly
met with in Africa<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6663src" href=
"#xd21e6663" name="xd21e6663src">19</a> and in North and South America,
from Canada to Patagonia.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6669src" href=
"#xd21e6669" name="xd21e6669src">20</a></p>
<p>The funeral rites of which we have spoken necessarily imply burial;
man did not abandon to wild beasts or birds of prey the bodies of those
who had once been like himself. At Aurignac, at Bruniquel, and in the
Frontal Cave, the cave man bad taken the precaution of closing with the
largest stones he could find the entrances to the last resting-places
of those belonging to him. The caves of <i>L&rsquo;Homme Mort</i>, and
of Petit-Morin which date from <span class="corr" id="xd21e6681" title=
"Source: Neolithitic">Neolithic</span> times, retain traces of similar
blocking up. There were five entrances to the cave of Garenne de
Verneuil (Marne) in which was a regular ossuary; the floor was paved
and the roof kept up with eleven upright stones. The objects in the
tomb with the dead were a clumsy earthenware vase, a few flint knives,
and some shell necklace beads.</p>
<p>The sides of the almost inaccessible mountains of Peru are pierced,
at a height of several hundred feet, with numerous caves which have
nearly all been artificially <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6686"
href="#xd21e6686" name="xd21e6686">355</a>]</span>enlarged. It was in
them that the Peruvians placed their dead, and the people of the
country still call them <i>Tantama Marca</i> or abodes of desolation.
The entrances were concealed with extreme care, but this care did not
save the tombs from violation; the greed for the treasures supposed to
be concealed in the tombs was too great for respect to the unknown dead
to hold curiosity in check.</p>
<p>In other cases, the dead was laid near the hearth which had been
that of his home when living, and his abode during life became his
tomb. The dolmens, <i>cella</i>, and <i>Gangraben</i> in Germany, and
the barrows in England, appear to bear witness to the prevalence of a
similar custom in those countries; and we find the same idea
perpetuated even when cremation became general. At Alba, in Latium, at
Marino, near Albano, at Vetulonia and Corneto-Tarquinia were discovered
urns with doors, windows, and a roof imitating human
dwellings.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6699src" href="#xd21e6699" name=
"xd21e6699src">21</a></p>
<p>Later, other modes of sepulture came into use. In Marne M. Nicaise
made out seven funeral pits<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6707src" href=
"#xd21e6707" name="xd21e6707src">22</a> resembling in shape, he tells
us, long-necked bottles with flat bottoms. One of these pits at
Tours-sur-Marne contained at least forty skeletons, and among the bones
were found thirty-four polished stone hatchets, fifty knives, two flint
lance-heads and a great many arrows with transverse edges, a necklace
of little round bits of limestone, several fragments of coarse pottery
which had been mixed with grains of silica and baked in the fire, and
lastly three little flasks made of stag-horn <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6712" href="#xd21e6712" name=
"xd21e6712">356</a>]</span>hollowed out in a curious manner and with
stoppers of the same material. These quaint little flasks doubtless
contained the coloring matter with which the dead had painted their
bodies when alive. All the objects of which we have spoken belonged to
the Neolithic period; but a flat bronze necklace bead made by folding a
thin slice of metal, a radius, and a bit of rib bearing green marks
resulting from long contact with metal, appear to fix the date of this
pit at the transition period between the Stone and Bronze ages. If this
be so it is quite an exceptional case of a sepulchral pit dating from
this time, for most of those known are of much later origin. Those for
instance of Mont-Beuvray, Bernard (La Vend&eacute;e), and Beaugency are
not older than Gallo-Roman times.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6714src"
href="#xd21e6714" name="xd21e6714src">23</a> According to Count
Gozzadini, those of Manzabotto in Italy, which are twenty-seven in
number, date from the IVth century after the foundation of Rome, and
are of Etruscan origin. They are constructed with small pointed
pebbles, with no trace of cement, and resemble in shape a long amphora
vase, or perhaps, to be more accurate, the clapper of a bell. They are
from six and a half to thirty-two and a half feet deep, with an opening
varying in diameter from one foot to nearly two and a half
feet.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6717src" href="#xd21e6717" name=
"xd21e6717src">24</a></p>
<p>We have said so much in preceding chapters on monuments erected in
memory of the dead, that but little remains to be added here. Doubtless
there are many distinctions to be noted at different times and in
different countries, but everywhere the aim remains <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6722" href="#xd21e6722" name=
"xd21e6722">357</a>]</span>the same, and the means used for attaining
that end are radically the same all the world over. Take for example
the Aymaras, the most ancient race of Bolivia and Callao; they laid
their dead sometimes beneath megalithic monuments (<a href=
"#fig058">Fig. 58, p. 178</a>) resembling the dolmens of Europe,
sometimes beneath towers or <i>chulpas</i>, which are however probably
of more recent date.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e6731width" id="fig105"><img src=
"images/fig105.jpg" alt="" width="168" height="227">
<p class="first">Chulpa near Palca.</p>
</div>
<p><i>Chulpas</i>, generally of square or rectangular form, consist of
a mass of unhewn stones faced outside with blocks of trachyte or
basalt, painted red, yellow, or white. A very low door, always facing
east, as if in honor of the rising sun, gives access to a cist in which
the dead was laid. The <i>chulpa</i> of our illustration (<a href=
"#fig105">Fig. 105</a>) is situated near the village of Palca; it rises
from an excavation four feet deep; its height is about sixteen feet,
and the cornice consists of <i>ichu</i>, a coarse grass which grows in
abundance on the mountains, and which after being firmly compressed was
cut with the help of sharp instruments. The human bones, which were
mixed together in the greatest confusion, made a heap in the sepulchral
chamber more than a foot high.</p>
<p>The mounds of Ohio also cover over sepulchral <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6750" href="#xd21e6750" name=
"xd21e6750">358</a>]</span>chambers of a peculiar construction, being
often formed of round pieces of wood, five to seven feet long by five
to six inches in diameter; near the bodies were placed a few ornaments,
chiefly copper ear-rings, shell beads, and large flint knives. Most of
the skeletons lay on the bare earth; but one exception is mentioned in
which the ground was paved with mussel shells. A remarkable discovery
has quite recently been made at Floyd (Iowa), the account of which in
Nature for January 1, 1891, we will give in the words of Clement
Webster: &ldquo;In making a thorough exploration of the larger mound
&hellip; the remains of five human bodies were found, the bones even
those of the fingers, toes, etc., being, for the most part in a good
state of preservation. First, a saucer or bowl-shaped excavation has
been made, extending down three and three-quarter feet below the
surface of the ground around the mound, and the bottom of this
macadamized with gravel and fragments of limestone. In the centre of
this floor five bodies were placed in a sitting posture with the feet
drawn under them, and apparently facing the north. First above the
bodies was a thin layer of earth and ashes, among which were found two
or three small pieces of fine-grained charcoal. Nearly all the
remaining four feet of earth had been changed to a red color by the
long-continued action of fire.&rdquo; Mr. Webster goes on to describe
the various skeletons and says of one of them, that of a woman:
&ldquo;The bones in their detail of structure indicated a person of low
grade, the evidence of unusual muscular development being strongly
marked. The skull of this personage was a wonder to behold, it
equalling if not rivalling in some respects and in inferiority of
grade, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6752" href="#xd21e6752" name=
"xd21e6752">359</a>]</span>the famous Neanderthal skull. The forehead,
if forehead it could be called, is very low, lower and more animal-like
than in the Neanderthal specimen&hellip;. The question has been raised
how was it that these five bodies were all buried here at the same
time, their bodies being still in the flesh.&rdquo; &hellip; Webster
adds that the probability is that all but one of <span class="corr" id=

<p class="first">Dolmen at Auvernier near the Lake of
Neuch&acirc;tel.</p>
</div>
<p>We have seen that men began by placing the bodies of their dead in
caves, and only later took to burying them underground when caves were
not to be had. Very often the corpse was placed between large unhewn
stones to keep off from it the weight of the tumulus above. Such were
the last resting-places alike of the men of Solutr&eacute; and of those
of Merovingian times. In the necropolis of Vilanova, which is supposed
to date from times prior to the foundation of Rome, the tombs enclosed
a chest, the walls of which consisted of slabs of sandstone set on edge
and connected by a conglomerate of small stones. At Marzabotto, the
chests are made of bricks, and placed beneath a heap of pebbles. We
reproduce a chest discovered near the Lake Dwellings of Auvernier in
Switzerland (<a href="#fig106">Fig. 106</a>)<a class="noteref" id=

<p>In other cases the dead body was enclosed in earthenware jars. At
Biskra in Algeria, two of these jars were found together; the one
containing the head, the other the feet of the departed. In some
instances the jar was replaced by a large clumsy earthenware basin,
some six and a half feet long by three feet wide. Such basins are
mentioned as having been found near Athens, but there is nothing to
help us to determine their date. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e6783" href="#xd21e6783" name="xd21e6783">361</a>]</span>The
ancient Iberians used one large jar only (<a href="#fig108">Fig.
108</a>) in which the dead was placed in a crouching position, still
wearing his favorite ornaments. The vase was closed with a stone cover
and placed in the tomb. We meet with the practice of a similar mode of
interment in historic times. The Chaldeans placed their dead in
earthenware vases; two jars connected at the neck serving as a coffin.
Excavations in Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s palace brought to light bodies
bent nearly double and enclosed in urns not more than three feet in
height by about two feet in width. On the western coast of Malabar, as
far as Cape Comorin, we find near megalithic tombs large jars four feet
high by three feet in diameter filled with human bones. This mode of
sepulture was practised at Sfax, in the Chersonesus of Thracia, and at
the foot of the hill on which Troy was built. The tumulus <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6788" href="#xd21e6788" name=

amphora in which crouched a skeleton, and the wealthy Japanese loved to
know they would rest in huge artistically decorated vases, masterpieces
of native pottery. If we cross the Atlantic, we meet with the same
custom in Peru, Mexico, and on the shores of the Mississippi. At
Teotihuacan, the bodies of children were placed head downwards in
funeral urns,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6790src" href="#xd21e6790"
name="xd21e6790src">26</a> and excavations in the alluvial deposits of
the Mississippi yielded, among immense quantities of pottery, two huge
rectangular basins glued together with clay and containing the body of
a young child. It is indeed interesting to meet with the same practice
in so many different places and to find the genius of many races
expressing itself in the same way in so many diverse inventions,
produced at times so widely separated.</p>

<p>It is probable that early man also turned to account the trees he
saw growing around him, using them as coffins for his dead. But the
rapid decay of this fragile case led to its total disappearance. A few
exceptions must, however, be mentioned. In 1840 some dredgers took from
the bed of the Sa&ocirc;ne, at Apremont, from beneath a bed of gravel
five feet thick, the trunk of a tree which still contained the bones
that had been placed in it. Similar discoveries were made in the Cher,
and in the celebrated cemetery of Hallstadt, near Salzburg. The cairns
of Scania covered over split trunks of oak and birch trees, which had
been hollowed out to receive the dead. At Gristhorpe, near Scarborough,
in England, a coffin was found made of scarcely squared planks roughly
put together; and another very like it was discovered at <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6803" href="#xd21e6803" name=

<p>The ancient Caledonians sewed up their dead in the skins of oxen
before burying them. The Egyptians also embalmed the ibis, the ox, the
cat, the crocodile, and other animals deified by them, and the bodies
of these creatures were then placed in vast subterranean chambers,
where they have been discovered in the present day in great numbers.
The Guanches of Teneriffe, the last representatives of the Iberians,
and probably the most ancient race of Europe, took out the intestines
of the corpse, dried the body in the air, painted it with a thick
varnish, and finally wrapped it in the skin of a goat. This last custom
was evidently a relic of the original idea of embalming, with a view to
rendering the mummy as nearly as possible indestructible and, to use a
happy expression of Michelet, to compel death to endure (<i>forcer la
mort de durer</i>). Our own contemporaries are thus able to look upon
the very features of those who preceded them on the earth some forty
centuries ago; and but yesterday photography reproduced in every detail
what was once Ramses the Great, one of the most glorious kings of
history.</p>

<p>Embalming was also practised in America. Recent travellers
report<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6820src" href="#xd21e6820" name=
"xd21e6820src">28</a> having seen in Upper Peru tombs of the shape of
beehives, made of stones cemented with clay, each tomb containing one
mummy or more in a crouching position (Figs. <a href="#fig109">109</a>
and <a href="#fig110">110</a>). This custom was still practised for
many centuries; Garcilasso de la <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e6832" href="#xd21e6832" name="xd21e6832">366</a>]</span>Vega
tells us that the dead Incas were seated in a temple at Cuzco, wearing
their royal ornaments as if they were still alive; their hands were
crossed upon their breasts, and their heads were bending slightly
forward.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6834src" href="#xd21e6834" name=

<p>The facts enumerated above prove that burial was long practised,
though it is impossible to say when it first cattle into use. About the
time of the beginning of the Bronze age, or perhaps even earlier,
however, a remarkable change took place in the ideas of man, and the
dead instead of being buried intact were consumed by fire on the
funeral pile.</p>
<p>What can have been the origin of this custom? What race first
practised it? It has long been supposed by many arch&aelig;ologists
that it was the Aryans from the lofty Hindoo Koosh Mountains who first
introduced into Europe a civilization more advanced than that which had
hitherto obtained there, and taught the people to cremate instead of
bury their dead. This theory was accepted for a considerable time
without question, but of late years a new school, headed by Penka, has
arisen who claim that the reformers came not from the East but from the
North. The Marquis de Saporta had indeed before suggested that the
primitive races who were the contemporaries of the mammoth and the
rhinoceros came originally from the polar regions, where the remains of
a luxuriant vegetation prove that climatic conditions prevailed in
remote times of a very different character to those of the present day.
The lignites of Iceland are made up of tulip, plantain, and nut-trees,
even the vine sometimes occurring. In the ferruginous sandstones,
associated with the carboniferous deposits of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6844" href="#xd21e6844" name=
"xd21e6844">367</a>]</span>Spitzberg, the beech, the poplar, the
magnolia, the plum tree, the sequoia, and numerous coniferous trees can
be made out. The sturdy sailors who dare the regions of perpetual ice
come across masses of fossilized wood in Banks, Grinnell, and Francis
Joseph&rsquo;s Lands, at 88&deg; N. Lat. Among this fossil wood Heer
made out the cypress, the silver pine, the poplar, the birch, and some
dicotyledons with caducous leaves. These were not relics of wood which
had drifted where it was found on floating ice, but of an actual local
vegetation, as proved by trunks still erect in their original
positions, buds, leaves, and flowers in every stage of growth, fruits
in every stage of ripening. The very insects that had lived on honey
from the flowers or on the leaves themselves could be identified. In
those remote days, life, abundant life, similar to that now only found
in the temperate countries farther south, flourished in those polar
regions, so long supposed to have never been anything but lifeless
deserts.</p>

<p>All this, plausible as it is, does not, however, appear to be
conclusive on the point under discussion; and though we may have to
abandon the idea of the Aryans having introduced cremation, we are
scarcely, I think, in a position to say that races from the North were
the first to practise it. I have dwelt more fully on the question of
the origin of races and the evidence which language seems to give of a
common source in two papers called &ldquo;Les Premiers Populations de
l&rsquo;Europe,&rdquo; which appeared in the <i>Correspondent</i> for
October 1 and November 25, 1889. Whatever may be the final decision on
the much contested points involved in this controversy, one thing is
certain that cremation, involving though it does a complete revolution
in manners and customs, spread with very great rapidity. We meet with
it from Greece to Scotland and Scandinavia, from Etruria to Poland and
the south of Russia, in China as in Yucatan and certain parts of
Central America.</p>
<p>In the early days of history, cremation was practised all over
Europe. The Greeks attribute its inauguration to Hercules, and the
funeral pile of Patrokles is described in the Iliad. The Pelasgians and
the Proto-Etruscans burned their dead,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6859src" href="#xd21e6859" name="xd21e6859src">30</a> and we are
told of the incineration of contemporaries of Jair, the third judge of
Israel.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the earliest inhabitants of Latium buried their
dead. Visitors, who probably came by way of the valley of the Danube,
introduced the new custom, and for a long tune the two rites were
practised side by side. At Felsina and at Marzabotto we find instances
alike of inhumation and cremation, and at <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e6868" href="#xd21e6868" name="xd21e6868">369</a>]</span>Vilanova
only half the tombs are those of corpses that had been cremated. In 365
of the tombs excavated in the Certosa, near Bologna, only 115 show
signs of cremation having been practised. At Rome, the two rites were
long both performed, probably, however, by the two distinct peoples who
formed the primitive population of the town of Romulus. We know that
Numa Pompilius forbade the burning of his corpse; Cicero relates that
Marius was buried, and that Sulla, his fortunate rival, was the first
of the Cornelia <i>gens</i> whose body was committed to the flames. We
do not know how early cremation was introduced in Gaul; we can only say
that C&aelig;sar found it generally practised when be made his
triumphal march across the country.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6873src"
href="#xd21e6873" name="xd21e6873src">31</a> The celebrated excavations
of Moreau prove that inhumation and incineration were both practised
among the Gallo-Romans established in the eastern provinces of France.
We may even assert that the two rites were practised long before the
introduction of the use of metals. One thing is certain, the custom of
cremation was but slowly abandoned as Christianity spread, for
Charlemagne, in an edict dated 789, ordered the punishment of death for
those who dared to burn dead bodies.</p>
<p>What we have just said about historic times applies equally to more
remote epochs. Thanks to the learned researches of Dr.
Pruni&egrave;res<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6881src" href="#xd21e6881"
name="xd21e6881src">32</a> we are able to trace for a great length of
time the modes of sepulture adopted in Loz&egrave;re. The cave men of
the eroded limestone districts of Les Causses took their dead to the
caves in which their ancestors had been laid, and the invaders, who
were probably more civilized than those they <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6886" href="#xd21e6886" name=
"xd21e6886">370</a>]</span>dispossessed, placed theirs beneath the
dolmens which they erected in their honor. In the sepulchral caves of
Rouquet and of <i lang="fr">L&rsquo;Homme Mort</i> we find inhumation;
beneath the megalithic monuments dating from the end of the Neolithic
period, we meet with the first traces of cremation, but so far of a
very incomplete cremation; the action of the funeral fire had not been
intense, and the bones were hard and resisted the heat. Noting beneath
certain dolmens a few bones blackened by fire mixed with large
quantities unaffected by it, one is inclined to think with the learned
Doctor, that after practising cremation men had reverted to the old
mode of burial. In the tumuli of the Bronze age, on the other hand,
where the date can be determined with the aid of the ornaments and
trinkets scatered about, the ustion was more complete; the bones are
friable and porous, crumbling into dust when touched, and there is
nothing to indicate that inhumation and cremation were both
practised.</p>
<p>It is strange indeed to find that incineration was practised from
Neolithic times in the wild mountains of Loz&egrave;re. There can be no
doubt on the point, however, and excavations beneath the dolmen of
Marconni&egrave;res strikingly confirm the earlier discoveries of Dr.
Pruni&egrave;res. Beneath a layer of broken stones and a very thin
pavement, was found a mass of human bones in the greatest confusion;
some still retaining their natural color, others blackened and charred
by. fire. Among these bones was picked up an arrow of rock foreign to
the country, three admirably polished lance-heads, and some finely cut
flint-darts. The dolmen contained no metal objects, and there was no
trace of metal on any of the bones. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e6893" href="#xd21e6893" name="xd21e6893">371</a>]</span></p>
<p>At the same period the two rites appear to have been practised
simultaneously in Armorica, but there incineration was the dominant
custom. In one hundred and forty-five megalithic monuments supposed to
date from the Neolithic period, seventy-two give proof of incineration
and twenty of inhumation only. The others yielded a few cinders, but it
was impossible to come to any definite conclusion. In many cases, as we
have seen, the megalithic monument was surrounded by a double or triple
<i>enceinte</i> of stones without mortar. Inside these <i>enceintes</i>
were some small circular structures made of stones reddened by the
action of heat. In the lower part of these structures were openings to
admit a current of air to fan the flames. These strange structures,
full of cinders and black greasy earth, bear the significant name of
<i lang="fr">Ruches de Cr&eacute;mation</i>.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6905src" href="#xd21e6905" name="xd21e6905src">33</a> Of
thirty-nine sepulchres of the Bronze age twenty-seven gave evidence of
incineration, two of inhumation, whilst ten decided nothing one way or
the other.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6908src" href="#xd21e6908" name=
"xd21e6908src">34</a> The dolmen of Mont St.-Michel and that of Tumiac
are separated by a short distance only; they were erected by the same
race and probably about the same period, yet at Mont St.-Michel we find
incineration, while inhumation was practised at Tumiac. How explain
this difference in funeral customs? Does it imply a diversity of race,
of caste, of religion, or of social position, or may it not rather be
explained as being merely the result of those later displacements which
upset the most careful reasoning? <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p>Whatever may have been the cause of the different modes of burial,
we meet with them in every country.</p>
<p>In Scandinavia, during the Bronze age, cremation and burial were
practised in about equal proportions. Similar facts are noticed in
Germany, but in the North incineration predominates, while in the West
it is inhumation. Beneath the cairns of Caithness in Scotland, we find
some bodies lying at full length, while others are in a bent position,
and large jars of coarse pottery filled with cinders and calcined bones
which had belonged to men of medium height. One of the largest of these
jars is fifteen or sixteen inches high by forty-nine wide at its
largest part.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6917src" href="#xd21e6917"
name="xd21e6917src">35</a> In excavating the barrows of the Orkney
Islands, Petrie noted the practice of both modes of burial<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6922src" href="#xd21e6922" name=
"xd21e6922src">36</a>; but were those buried in manners so different
contemporaries? This is what we are not told, and what we have to find
out.</p>
<p>At Blendowo in Poland, beneath a cromlech was found an urn filled
with calcined bones, and thirty centimetres lower down a skeleton was
discovered buried in the sand. Near this body was found a coin of
Theodosius, and we wonder in vain whether both the individuals, whose
remains are thus within a common tomb, lived at the same time.
Throughout Prussia and in the Grand Duchy of Posen skeletons and jars
containing human ashes are met with in the same tombs.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6930src" href="#xd21e6930" name=
"xd21e6930src">37</a> We must not forget to note, especially, the
necropolis of Hallstadt, which was situated in the heart of the
district of Bohemia occupied by the Boii. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e6936" href="#xd21e6936" name="xd21e6936">373</a>]</span>The most
ancient of the tombs in these vast burial-places date from about two
thousand years before the Christian era, and the Hallstadtian period,
as it is sometimes called, culminated during the first half of the
millennium immediately before the coming of Christ.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e6938src" href="#xd21e6938" name="xd21e6938src">38</a> Nine
hundred and ninety-three tombs have been excavated; all, to judge by
the objects found with the human remains, belonging to the Bronze age;
of these five hundred and twenty-seven contained buried bodies, and
four hundred and fifty-three cremated relics.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6947src" href="#xd21e6947" name="xd21e6947src">39</a> This is a
larger proportion than in the primitive necropoles of Italy.</p>
<p>In the tombs in which burial was practised, the bodies were laid in
the trench without covering, and the remains of anything in the way of
slabs or coffins or protecting planks are very rare; in those tombs in
which cremation had been the rule, ustion had often been very
incomplete, sometimes the head and sometimes the feet having escaped
the flames.</p>
<p>Similar facts are noted at Watsch, at San Margarethen, and at Vermo
in Styria, at Rovesche in Southern Carniola, and at Rosegg in the
valley of the Drave. At Watsch, but ten skeletons were found, among two
hundred examples of incineration. In the cremation sepulchres, if we
may so call them, the cinerary urn was protected by large slabs; while
in those where burial was practised, the bodies were simply confided to
the earth as at Hallstadt; but by a singular contrast, the latter tombs
contained much more important <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6957"
href="#xd21e6957" name="xd21e6957">374</a>]</span>relics, the objects
with the dead being more valuable and of finer workmanship. At
Rovesche, the urn was placed in a square chest made of unhewn stones.
The buried bodies lay with the head turned toward the east, an urn was
placed at their feet, and their shrouds were kept in place by bronze
fibul&aelig;, while on the fingers were many rings of the same
metal.</p>
<p>Lastly, to conclude this gloomy catalogue, excavations in the mounds
of Ohio and Illinois<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6961src" href=
"#xd21e6961" name="xd21e6961src">40</a> have shown that there too
cremation and inhumation are met with in sepulchres which everything
tends to assign to the same race and the same period.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e6966src" href="#xd21e6966" name="xd21e6966src">41</a> The
sepulchral crypts of Missouri contain several skeletons which had been
subjected to intense heat. The human bones were mixed with the remains
of animals, fragments of charcoal, and pieces of pottery, with sortie
flint weapons. In a neighboring mound excavations revealed no trace of
cremation; the bodies were stretched out upon the ground, and those who
discovered them picked up near them a valuable collection of flints and
of carefully made pottery. There is however nothing to show whether
those who buried and those who burnt their dead belonged to the same
race or lived at the same time. Cremation long survived among the most
savage tribes of Alaska and California, where it is still practised,
and the Indians of Florida preserve the ashes of their fathers in human
skulls. In California, the relations of the deceased covered their
faces with a thick paste of a kind of loam mixed with the ashes of the
dead, and were compelled to wear this sign of their grief until it fell
off naturally. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6972" href=
"#xd21e6972" name="xd21e6972">375</a>]</span></p>
<p>Although we meet with the burial of the dead either in a recumbent
or a crouching position, everywhere the minor ceremonies connected with
death are innumerable; each people, each race, indeed, having its own
custom, handed down from one generation to another, and piously
preserved intact by each successive family. Feasting was from the
earliest times a feature of the funeral ceremonies. An edict of
Charlemagne forbids eating and drinking on the tombs of the deceased,
and Saint Boniface, the apostle of Germany, complains bitterly that the
priests encouraged by their presence these feasts of death. We meet
with the same kind of thing among the lower classes at the present day,
and the cemeteries of Paris are surrounded with caf&eacute;s and wine
shops, where too often grief is drowned in wine. The custom of holding
these feasts really comes down from the earliest inhabitants of Europe,
and the savage cave man gorged himself with food upon the tombs of
those belonging to him. At Aurignac, in the cave of <i>L&rsquo;Homme
Mort</i>, in the Trou du Frontal, broken bones and fragments of
charcoal bear witness to the repast. Similar traces of feasts are met
with beneath the dolmens and the tumuli. From the Long Barrows have
been taken the skulls and feet of bovid&aelig;, and it is probable that
the other parts of the body had been devoured by the assistants, and
that the head and feet were placed in the tomb as an offering either to
the dead or to the divinities who are supposed to have presided at the
death. In the ancient sepulchres of Wiltshire Sir R. Colt Hoare picked
up the bones of boars, stags, sheep, horses, and dogs; which he too
considered were the remains of funeral feasts.</p>
<p>Were feasts the only ceremonies connected with interments?
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6981" href="#xd21e6981" name=
"xd21e6981">376</a>]</span>We think not. The body was often placed in
the centre of the sepulchral chamber, and around it were ranged the
wives, servants, and slaves of the deceased, condemned to follow their
chief into the unknown world to which he had gone. Beneath a dolmen of
Algeria was found a crouching skeleton with two crania lying at his
feet, which crania had doubtless belonged to victims immolated in his
honor. The barrows of Great Britain preserve traces of human
sacrifices, and C&aelig;sar says in speaking of the Gauls: &ldquo;Their
funerals are magnificent and sumptuous. Everything supposed to have
been dear to the defunct during his life was flung upon the funeral
pile; even his animals were sacrificed, and until quite recently his
slaves and the dependants he had loved were burnt with
him.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6983src" href="#xd21e6983" name=
"xd21e6983src">42</a></p>
<p>The facts we have been noticing prove that early man cherished hopes
of immortality. All was not ended for him with death; a new life
commences beyond the tomb, marked&mdash;for his ideas could go no
farther&mdash;by joys similar to those he had known on earth, and
events such as had occurred during his life. What else could be the
meaning of the weapons, the tools of his craft, the vases filled with
food placed near the defunct, the ornaments and colors intended for his
adornment, the wives, slaves, and horses flung into the same tomb or
consumed upon the same pile? It is pleasing to find this supreme hope
among our remote ancestors; and clumsily as it was expressed, it
implies a belief in a being superior to man, a protecting divinity
according to some, but according to some few others a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6988" href="#xd21e6988" name=
"xd21e6988">377</a>]</span>malignant and tyrannical spirit. The proofs
so far to hand are not enough to justify us in seriously asserting that
ancestors were worshipped by prehistoric man. But the subject is too
important for us to refrain from putting before the reader such
indications of this worship as have been collected, and which are
necessarily connected with the moral and material condition of our
remote ancestors.</p>
<p>The radius of a mammoth was discovered at Chaleux, occupying a place
of honor on a large sandstone slab near the hearth. The Chaleux Cave
dates from the Reindeer period; at which time the mammoth had long
since been extinct in Belgium, so that there can be no doubt that the
cave man had taken this bone from the alluvial deposits of the
preceding epoch, and this huge relic of an unknown creature had been
the object of his veneration, a lar or protective divinity of his home.
A somewhat similar fact was discovered at Laugerie-Basse and, by a
strange coincidence, certain tribes of North America of the present
clay preserve the bone of a mastodon or of a cetacean in their huts as
a protection to their homes.</p>
<p>From Paleolithic times men were in the habit of cutting celts or
hatchets in chalk, bitumen, and other fragile substances, which were
certainly of no practical use. Thousands of similar objects in harder
rock, but showing no sign of wear or tear, have also been found, and
there is little doubt that they all alike served as amulets. This
superstitious respect for certain objects lasted for many centuries,
and was handed down from one generation to another. The tombs of the
Bronze and Iron ages are often found to contain flint hatchets, some of
them broken intentionally, a proof, as I have <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6994" href="#xd21e6994" name=
"xd21e6994">378</a>]</span>already said, that they were connected with
funeral rites of the nature of which we are ignorant.</p>
<p>We also find votive hatchets beneath dolmens. By the side of some
skeletons at Cissbury lay flint celts. A hatchet one and a quarter feet
long was found in a Lake Station of Switzerland. It was of such friable
rock that it can have been of no use but as a symbol; perhaps, indeed,
it may have been a badge of office. Lastly, Merovingian tombs contain
hundreds of small flint celts, the last pious offerings to the
departed.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6998src" href="#xd21e6998" name=
"xd21e6998src">43</a></p>
<p>We find hatchets engraved on the megalithic monuments of Brittany,
on the walls of the caves of Marne, and we meet with them again on the
other side of the Atlantic, evidently bearing the same signification,
implying respect for them as means of protection. De Longp&eacute;rier
has published a description of a Chaldean cylinder, on which was
represented a priest presenting his offering to a hatchet lying on a
throne, and a ring was picked up at Myken&aelig;, on the stone of which
was engraved a double-bladed celt. We find the same idea in many
different mythologies. The word <i>Nouter</i> (God) is translated in
Egyptian hieroglyphics by a sign resembling a celt, and the hatchet of
Odin is engraved on the rocks of Kivrik. On a number of Gallo-Roman
<i>cippi</i>, we find a hatchet beneath which we read the words,
<i lang="la">Dis Manibus</i>, and lower down the dedication, <i lang=
"la">Sub Ascia dedicavit</i>. At all times and everywhere the hatchet
appears as the emblem of force, and is the object of the respect of the
people. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e7015" href="#xd21e7015"
name="xd21e7015">379</a>]</span>The tradition of its value and
importance is handed down from ancestors to descendants throughout many
generations.</p>

<p>May we give a religious interpretation to the basins and cups
hollowed out on rocks and erratic blocks and on the so-called Roches
Moutonn&eacute;es, with other monuments that have endured for many
centuries (Figs. <a href="#fig111">111</a> and <a href=
"#fig112">112</a>)? Or must we attribute them merely to passing
caprice? Their number and importance we think forbid the latter idea.
We find such blocks in Switzerland, in England, France, Italy,
Portugal, and on the frozen shores of the Baltic. They are no less
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e7030" href="#xd21e7030" name=
"xd21e7030">380</a>]</span>numerous in India, and they figure in the
curious pictographs of the two Americas. There is no doubt that we have
here a common idea, and one it is impossible not to recognize. How else
can we account for the similarity of arrangement in the cup-shaped
sculptures from the tumuli of Schleswig-Holstein and those on the
Indian rocks of Kamaou, or between those of Algeria and of England?</p>

<p class="first">Engraved rock from Massibert (Loz&egrave;re).</p>
</div>
<p>In Brittany and in Scotland these cup-like sculptures are found on
rocks and menhirs, on the walls of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e7039" href="#xd21e7039" name=
"xd21e7039">381</a>]</span>sepulchral chambers, on stones forming the
sides of <i>kistv&aelig;ns</i>, accompanied in many instances with
radiated circles, which do not, however, help us to understand them
better. In Scandinavia they are known as <i>Elfen Stenavs</i>, or elf
stones, and the inhabitants come and place offerings on them for the
<i>Little People</i>. According to a touching tradition, these little
people are souls awaiting the time of their being clothed once more in
human flesh. In Belgium these strangely decorated stones are attributed
to the <i>Nutons</i>, dwarfs who are very helpful to mortals. In every
country there is some legend sacred to the sculptured stones.</p>
<p>Such are the only facts we have been able to collect respecting the
religious feeling of prehistoric races. They are not sufficient to
authorize any final conclusion on the subject. At every turn we are
compelled to admit our helplessness. But yesterday this past without a
limit was absolutely unknown to us, and to-day we are but beginning to
be able to obtain a glimpse into its secrets. We have been the laborers
of the first hour, it will be for those who come after us to complete
the task we have been able but to begin. May a genuine love of truth be
to them, as we may justly claim it has been to us, the only guide.</p>

were also carried on in the same cave in 1879 by M. Bucquoy (<i lang=

ossiferous levels and picked up some flints of the Moust&eacute;rien
